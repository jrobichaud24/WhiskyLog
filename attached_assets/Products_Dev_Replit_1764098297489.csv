This limited bottling shows how a mature spirit can shine with a touch of French elegance.","Even the nosing of this whisky is an experience. Notes of dates and figs rise to the nose, carried by a gentle hint of light-coloured grapes and clove. An interesting �sandy� undertone is reminiscent of a walk in an autumn landscape - earthy, slightly rough and inviting at the same time. After the first sip, increasingly fruity flavours unfold, intensifying the impression.","On the tongue, the Aberfeldy 18 year old is initially creamy - almost like a velvety wine. But then the Highlands make their unmistakable mark: oak and a hint of coloured pepper provide a spicy base, accompanied by subtle notes of red fruit. The slightly vinous note from the maturation in French red wine casks adds an elegant dimension without being too dominant.","And then comes the finish - wow! The interplay of flavours reaches its climax here. A clear strawberry note leads into raspberry ice cream before everything dissolves into a creamy, spicy warmth.

Bright fruits, such as quince and pomegranate, open the bouquet, followed by an intense mélange of strong oak tones. Sweet notes of marzipan and forest honey round off the profile, while floral accents of lilac and daisies provide an extraordinary complexity. The oak is omnipresent, surrounding the sweet fruit and giving the whisky a spicy depth that is almost overwhelming in its complexity.","The complexity continues on the palate. Dried peaches and shortbread form the sweet base, while white bread and old oak provide a savoury, almost creamy texture. The balance between velvety spiciness and an almost bacony note reminiscent of lard makes this Highlander a unique experience. It is as if time itself has softened the whisky without taking away its characterful structure.","The finish is long and characterised by a spicy oak presence. Bright dried fruit flavours flash up again and accompany the finish, which is moderately spectacular but still very pleasant.

Sweet honey notes meet a hint of red wine - a little like a glass of dessert wine on a winter evening. This is joined by the freshness of oranges and a hint of crème brûlée, which rounds off the whole flavour with a light vanilla note. In the background: subtle oak that pleasantly grounds the fragrance.","With the first sip it becomes clear: this whisky has a personality! The attack is surprisingly sweet, almost candy-like, before the red wine influence comes through - fruity and a little tannic. But then comes the twist: a slight smokiness is noticeable, surprising for a Speyside whisky. Fruity notes, especially orange, remain present, but an astringent, slightly dry texture ensures that the whisky is not one-dimensional. The cask strength makes for a powerful experience that is never overpowering.","In the finish, the Allt-a-Bhainne 2005 shows a different side.

Lovage literally jumps into the nose and is reminiscent of a savoury kitchen aroma. This is accompanied by unusually distinctive notes of tobacco, followed by a softer sweetness reminiscent of caramel and rape honey. Delicate hints of toasted bread and a slightly cakey fragrance resonate in the background, giving the whole a warm base.","A veritable rollercoaster unfolds on the palate. The entry is intense and direct - fruitcake with a hint of apricot, before a wild shift to maritime notes. Dried seaweed, a hint of iodine and even something reminiscent of wall paint give the whisky an industrial, almost wild flavour. Mint and heather add a refreshing complexity that gives the character depth.

Today we have a 24-year-old Ben Nevis from Zanzibar in our glass - a bottling with character?","The nose welcomes us with a surprising lightness. Floral notes mingle with a gentle vanilla sweetness, accompanied by malty undertones and a hint of foliage. Gentle herbal flavours also resonate, giving the whisky a certain depth. The oak remains discreetly in the background - present, but by no means intrusive.","Here the Ben Nevis shows a completely different side. The oak is now clearly evident and brings a lovely spiciness with it. At the same time, a pleasant sweetness pushes forward - candy floss and a hint of stevia provide a slightly playful sweetness that harmonises wonderfully with the malty notes.

Add to that deeply overripe red fruits, baked apple and sugar beet – it’s an aromatic tapestry that unfolds slowly and rewards patience.","On the palate, this whisky is surprisingly vivid. Despite its age, it’s oily, full-bodied and layered. The entry is sweet, with orange and grapefruit bringing a light tang. Then the cask takes over: curry, Indian spices, and dry tannic structure.

This 34-year-old bottling from 1984, released by van Wees, demonstrates the transformative effects of decades of maturation in the Lowlands region. Be warned: This whisky challenges the senses and offers an extraordinary experience you won�t forget anytime soon.","The aroma is a conversation starter. At first, it evokes a gas station � a hint of industrial notes that catch you off guard. Beneath this layer lies a fruity core: overripe cherries, coconut, and a touch of exotic mango, nectarine, and peach. Cashew nuts and a sense of decayed wood add earthy undertones, lending complexity to the bouquet.","On the palate, this whisky is powerful and multifaceted. The 54.90% ABV makes its presence known without overwhelming. Spicy oak takes the lead, supported by deep dark red fruits in the background. Then it takes an unexpected turn: an extreme dryness reminiscent of chalk dominates the mouthfeel, while an outstandingly oily texture makes the whisky almost viscous. A hint of soapiness may polarize, but it adds an intriguing layer to the complexity.","The finish surprises with its discrepancy.

White peaches whisper sweet secrets, while hazelnut provides an earthy base that reminds you where you are - on a Scottish island that is normally known for completely different flavours.","The nutty and spicy notes embrace the tongue like old friends, while white pepper provides a surprising spiciness that harmonises perfectly with the 57.30%. Vanilla ice cream - yes, actual vanilla ice cream - melts on the tongue and mingles with yeasty notes so intense that you wonder whether you're tasting a whisky or a craft beer.

And then there are those that smile at you sweetly � only to throw a ginger bomb onto your palate a second later. The Glen Moray 2007/2021, bottled by Malts of Scotland, belongs to this third category � a surprising and exciting release from the Glen Moray distillery, located in the Speyside region near the Highlands. Aged for 14 years in a bourbon cask, bottled at a bold 56.3% ABV, non-chill filtered, natural colour � just the way we purists like it.","Once poured, the aromatic performance begins. The first impressions? Peach and apricot � nonstop. Ripe, almost tropically lush fruits, wrapped in a sweetness reminiscent of gummy bears � think Haribo Tropifrutti. Below that lies crumbly iced tea, somewhere between peach and black tea, with a touch of honey, very clear and floral. Then comes a wave of vanilla pudding topped with whipped cream. This is a bourbon cask bouquet overload that�s not simply typical � it�s compelling and multilayered. Even those who think they�ve tasted enough bourbon-matured whiskies might find themselves surprised.","The initial mouthfeel is slightly effervescent, perhaps due to the high ABV, yet never harsh � more like a ginger shot served with a wink. Then, a creamy texture unfolds, echoing that earlier vanilla pudding. Layers of lemon zest, lychee, and dragon fruit add freshness and finesse. The contrast is what makes this dram exciting: it begins like a comforting dessert, only to suddenly deliver a spicy punch with ginger and citrus. It�s different.

Since the grand opening of its visitor centre on July 6th, 2004, the distillery has continued to evolve while staying true to its roots. Interestingly, Glen Moray played a key role in the early days of wood finishing experiments � a technique that would later make Glenmorangie world-famous.  With the Port Cask Finish, Glen Moray presents a no-age-statement single malt matured in ex-bourbon barrels before receiving a finishing period in port wine casks. Bottled at a friendly 40% ABV, it's an ideal choice for those new to whisky.","Right from the first sniff, the whisky offers a warm and inviting aroma. Notes of white chocolate, a subtle wine-like character, and a gentle touch of leather emerge. Black cherries add fruity depth, supported by a pleasantly malty sweetness. The nose invites you to take that first sip.","On the palate, sweetness takes the lead � clearly showcasing the influence of the port cask. A light bitterness provides a nice balance. Hints of caramel and vanilla mingle with soft oak, and there�s a touch of youthful spirit that gives it a charming character rather than being a drawback.","The finish is short but harmonious.

Oatmeal, unripe bananas and subtle spice – technically flawless, but not challenging.","The olfactory analysis immediately reveals the characteristic Glen Ord DNA: a distinctly cereal-based structure dominates, with oatmeal notes forming the primary aroma structure. These cereal components are created by Glen Ord's specific mashing process at a mash temperature of 63-65°C, which ensures optimal starch conversion with minimal tannin extraction. Secondary fruit esters present themselves in the form of unripe banana notes – a typical characteristic of relatively young Highland distillates matured in ex-bourbon casks. Traces of vanilla, attributable to lignin degradation in American oak, support the aroma profile, while subtle citrus and pineapple components indicate clean fermentation with controlled ester formation processes. Peach notes complete the fruit spectrum and are created by specific acetates that are favoured by Glen Ord's moderate distillation temperatures.","The technical precision of Glen Ord's distillation process is evident on the palate: a remarkably mild texture with a malty-sweet base structure dominates the mouthfeel. The sweetness results from residual sugars and glycerine compounds, which are preserved by the gentle distillation in Glen Ord's copper pot stills. Lightly perfumed notes – probably terpenic compounds from the new make spirit – give the whisky a floral dimension without being intrusive. White toast character shows moderate cask integration: the American oak has imparted its primary vanillin and tannins without dominating. A subtle saltiness, possibly from coastal storage in the Highlands, balances the sweetness and enhances the pear fruitiness. The texture is remarkably smooth – an indicator of clean distillation without sulphur compounds or fusel oils. This 'ironed' characteristic speaks for excellent technical control throughout the production chain.","The finish is deliberately restrained – a technical decision that is typical for 46% ABV and 10 years of maturation. A barely perceptible finish with minimal wood tannins indicates first-fill American oak casks that have already released their most aggressive components to previous contents. Slight dryness and spicy notes develop gradually, revealing the beginnings of a complexity that would become more intense with longer storage. This subtle development is characteristic of mid-aged Highland distillates.",https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-ord-2011-2021-10-year-old-van-wees-en,admin,"""2025-10-10T15:36:16.251Z""","""2025-10-10T15:36:16.251Z""",https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-ord-2011-2021-10-year-old-van-wees.png

Dried plums dominate the 'dried fruit fuss', as I affectionately call it - those concentrated, sweet flavours that are typical of good sherry maturation. The whole thing is slightly dry and pleasantly spicy.

The Wemyss family, already known as an independent bottler, has been operating Kingsbarns since 2014. For this whisky, Isabella Wemyss relies on maturation in Oloroso sherry casks made of American white oak. The result? A smooth, sweet dram that carries the signature of this young distillery.","Right from the first sniff, Balcomie reveals its fresh character. Vanilla rises to the nose, followed by crisp apples and pears. A hint of Federweißer adds a certain liveliness. Subtle notes of milk chocolate and a grainy base aroma reminiscent of freshly malted barley round out the profile.","On the palate, the whisky is malty and fruity-fresh. Notes of fruit bread and coconut lend it a sweet, slightly exotic component. The spice remains pleasantly restrained: white pepper, gentle oak spice, and a hint of cinnamon provide balance.

There is a slight hint of iodine, just as you would expect from a Lagavulin.

Sour cherries dominate the attack, accompanied by a mineral, earthy base note reminiscent of wet earth after a downpour. The sulphur is also present here, albeit more discreetly than on the nose. An interesting sweet and sour dynamic develops, supported by citrus notes reminiscent of pink grapefruit. The driftwood note that spreads across the mid-palate is particularly fascinating. It lends the whisky a maritime depth that perfectly matches its origin from the Isle of Mull.","The finish surprises with its length and unexpected sweetness.

These fresh fruit notes are elegantly accompanied by creamy custard buns, whose warm sweetness creates a cosy atmosphere. Particularly noteworthy is the pronounced vanilla note that runs like a golden thread through the entire aroma profile. This is joined by subtle notes of white tea and white peach, which only fully unfold after a few minutes in the glass.","The first impression is dominated by creamy honey, which coats the tongue like velvet and creates a luxurious foundation. The waxy notes are reminiscent of a Clynelish and blend harmoniously with the aforementioned vanilla to create a veritable taste experience. Fresh grape notes are surprisingly distinct, while a warm cinnamon note provides the necessary spice and, accompanied by aromas of burnt toast, adds a rustic, almost bakery-like dimension.","The finish of this exceptional Longmorn is characterised by a surprising abundance of soft wood notes, which clearly demonstrate how well the distillate has harmonised with the casks.

A whisky that is too clever for us.","When we first smell it, we simultaneously think: 'Grandma's old woodshed in the countryside.' But how chic! There's a hint of rotten, damp wood in the air, as if someone had opened an antique chest. Behind it, heavy red fruits creep in � think of overripe plums that have been lying in the fruit bowl a little too long. A hint of beeswax makes it creamy, while slightly earthy notes (forest floor after rain?) provide grounding. Then it becomes apothecary-like: nutmeg appears like an old acquaintance, followed by an entire apothecary cabinet full of tinctures and herbs. Chalk! Yes, damn it, school chalk. And as if that weren't confusing enough, rose water also floats through � elegant but restrained, like a distinguished lady who doesn't wear too much perfume. This nose is complicated. It demands attention. It wants you to sit down and listen. We nod obediently, but only understand half of it.","The first sip makes your mouth tingle � you know, that prickly, almost electric sensation on your tongue. The spice hits you immediately: this is no gentle start, it's an explosion of flavour. But � and this is where it gets interesting � despite this intensity, everything remains incredibly well-rounded. Freshly roasted coffee makes its presence felt, followed by slightly burnt nut cake (you know, the crust that everyone wants). White peach brings a fruity freshness that we didn't expect. The whole thing is extremely delicate and multi-layered � as if someone were conducting an orchestra in which each instrument plays solo at times. The spicy oak is always present, but never dominant. It's like a good conductor: you know he's there, but he doesn't push himself into the foreground. After 40 years of barrel ageing, it would have been quite a feat not to become woody.","'It draaaaaags on like chewing gum,' we note. And it's true. This finish knows no end. Soft wood nestles on the palate, lots of oak (surprise!) spreads out, and cinnamon and nutmeg slowly, very slowly, fade away. You sit there, sip, wait, and the whisky is still there.

Sounds cheesy? It is. Slightly grassy - as if someone had pressed a meadow into the shape of a bottle. A touch of honey joins in, followed by wet straw (that sounds less appetising than it smells) and a slightly vinous hint that is subtly reminiscent of the white port finish. The best thing: despite the 61.1% alcohol strength, nothing burns unnecessarily in the nose. Nc'nean has obviously understood how to civilise strong whiskies without robbing them of their personality.","The first sip inevitably makes you think: 'Oily, sweet, perfect!' The whisky covers the tongue like a velvety coat - peach and honey dance the tango, while a real fruit club waits in the background. And yes, we're talking about a kind of 5-fruit cocktail from a can here - but the good kind, not the stuff from the discount store.

Others whisper – and yet their echoes linger in memory. Oban The Macleans Young Teddy (2023) belongs to the latter. A limited edition from the storied Oban Distillery in the Scottish Highlands – boldly bottled at 50.8% ABV, but without an age statement.

Malty at the core – like opening a box of cereal on a quiet Sunday morning. But before you settle into comfort, complexity kicks in like a double-decker bus to the sinuses: Pear, apricot, mirabelle – bright, juicy, almost crystalline. Caramel reminiscent of soft fudge. Then, a full-on patisserie parade: buttery croissant, biscuit dough, strawberry tartlet – it’s a Parisian brunch on a balcony. A whisper of white tea? Yes. Subtly floral with a delicate astringency.","The arrival is: creamy, almost viscous. 'Indefinably light-fruited” may sound like a cop-out – but it’s the most honest descriptor. Like a beam of light through fog – you sense it, but can’t grasp it. Then comes white pepper, sharp but not harsh. A hint of leather? Maybe. Wet coffee grounds – earthy, dark, damp. Oddly compelling. And just a hint of green tobacco, freshly cut, almost chlorophyllic. A sensory collage that refuses linearity – and yet remains surprisingly balanced.","The finish is the bridge back to reality – but it doesn’t let you leave easily. There’s good oak, but no bitterness. A little caramel, some honey, and then – cheekily – a salty kiss. Maritime, but not stormy. You sense that a sherry cask was somewhere in the process – but only briefly. Maybe the whisky just waved hello as it passed by. Different? Yes. Bizarre?

In 2024, the Roseisle 12 Year Old Origami Kite 2 is a whisky from a distillery that was only founded in 2010 and has barely made an appearance as a single malt to date. Scepticism is appropriate - especially with a proud price that competes with established Speyside classics.","The first impression is characterised by a warm maltiness that combines with honey-like aromas. Apple crumble brings a beautiful, buttery-fruity component into play, while fresh wood and mint provide a certain lightness. A subtle candyfloss note lends the whisky a gentle sweetness. Overall, a pleasant, typical Speyside profile, but without any major surprises.","On the palate, the Roseisle 12 Year Old is unexpectedly herbal, which gives it an interesting, slightly bitter flavour. This is followed by a creamy vanilla ice cream sweetness, which is quickly overlaid by strong oak and spicy ginger. Forest honey provides a pleasant depth and a buttery croissant note gives the whisky a certain elegance. The 55.6% ABV is well integrated, but still gives the whisky a noticeable strength.","The finish is long, spicy and dry, with dominant oak and an interesting mix of apricot, sandalwood and cinnamon. A slight white pepper note provides additional spiciness. Not spectacular, but a solid and aromatically well-balanced finish.",https://thewhiskyedition.com/roseisle-12-year-old-origami-kite-2-diageo-special-releases-2024-en,admin,"""2025-10-10T15:37:13.112Z""","""2025-10-10T15:37:13.112Z""",https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/roseisle-12-year-old-origami-kite-2-diageo-special-releases-2024.png

The sweetness of cinnamon and sugar harmonises with a creamy apple sauce aroma, as if the best autumn flavours had been captured in a bottle. The whisky feels oily and full-bodied, nestling comfortably on the palate, wonderfully carried by the 46% ABV.","After the last sip, the Royal Brackla remains present for a long time.

This Highland malt proves that even unknown gems can shine.,"The very first swirl in the glass reveals the impressive complexity of this Royal Brackla. The nose is very malty, forming a solid foundation of roasted grain reminiscent of freshly baked bread. Above this malty base, floral notes unfold, reminiscent of heather blossoms and delicate meadow flowers � typical of the Highland region and wonderfully balanced.  The lemon zest is particularly appealing, adding a fresh, lively note to the aroma profile without being overpowering. The sweet, oily texture of the aromas envelops the senses and carries a hint of vanilla that harmonises perfectly with the burnt toast. These roasted aromas are never bitter, but lend the whisky a comforting warmth. The overall impression on the nose is remarkably clean and rounded.","The oily, smooth texture caresses the mouth and carries the flavours with an almost buttery creaminess. The ginger stands out clearly and brings a pleasant, warming spiciness that perfectly complements the cask strength and never seems aggressive. The malty-sweet notes from the nose continue and are complemented by a surprisingly fruity component: candied pear is elegant and gives the whisky a subtle sweetness reminiscent of high-quality patisserie. This fruitiness is not overpowering, but blends harmoniously into the overall picture and ensures a perfect balance between malt, spices and sweet elements.","The ginger flavour continues on the palate, creating a warming effect that spreads pleasantly throughout the mouth and throat. The oak profile that emerges in the finish is particularly impressive � not too dominant, but present enough to make the 10 years of ageing noticeable. The medium-length finish is just right and is rounded off by a slightly herbal note that is strikingly reminiscent of Ricola lemon.",https://thewhiskyedition.com/royal-brackla-10-year-old-2014-2024-thompson-bros-en,admin,"""2025-10-28T01:28:35.239Z""","""2025-10-28T01:28:35.239Z""",https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/royal-brackla-10-year-old-2014-2024-thompson-bros.png

A marvellous aroma of dark plums rises to the nose, accompanied by a pleasant hint of cocoa. This is accompanied by slightly leathery nuances - not necessarily what you would expect after a wellness weekend, but certainly full of character. There is a hint of something musty, which gives the whole thing an earthy depth. Most interesting, however, are the pickled red fruits, which smell like a well-stocked jam jar from grandma's pantry.","Black pepper dominates the first encounter and makes it clear that this Highland malt makes no compromises. Nutmeg joins the mix and creates a thoroughly spicy mood. If you like it mild, you should perhaps try a Glenfiddich 12 first - this Royal Brackla means business. Sultanas and prunes bring a pleasant sweetness into play, but it never dominates. It's as if someone has added a generous helping of spices to a clay pot full of pickled fruit. This combination works surprisingly well and gives the whisky a nice complexity.","The finish is quite dry and warming - exactly what you want after a long day.

It's like walking through the kitchen of a castle where fresh white bread is being baked � slightly yeasty, warm and inviting. But Royal Brackla wouldn't be royal if it didn't have something special: floral notes dance through the air like petals in the castle grounds, while grainy components provide a solid base. Apricot aromas sneak in discreetly � sweet, juicy and tempting. The highlight? Sandalwood notes that lend the whole an almost exotic elegance, followed by creamy marshmallows that awaken every childhood dream. This olfactory spectacle is rounded off by subtle nutty tones � sophisticated, but never intrusive.","The first sip starts like a fairy tale: sweet and creamy, the Royal Brackla caresses the tongue as if the royal chef himself were serving you the finest dessert. You think to yourself, 'Ah, this is going to be a relaxing evening!' But then � twist! Suddenly, a bitter wood note makes itself heard, as if the court jester had entered the hall unannounced. This bitterness is not necessarily unpleasant, but it is definitely surprising. It's as if the king suddenly shows his serious side. Slightly soapy notes join in (presumably the result of very clean distillation), while oatmeal textures provide a full-bodied feel. A subtle hint of liquorice hovers in the background � not dominant, but present enough to complete the flavour profile.","The finale is a mixture of nostalgia and reality. Vanilla returns like an old friend, accompanied by notes of yeast dough reminiscent of Sunday mornings at the bakery.

Vanilla joins in, but not as a soloist, rather as a member of an ensemble that knows when to step back. And then, the wood. Lots of wood. But not that young, aggressive oak that screams 'I'm here!', but the dignified wood of old furniture, polished by decades. Apricot and pear dance on the edge, dried fruits that have exchanged their sweetness for velvety depth. And – oh yes – green tobacco.

Full-bodied and oily, this whisky envelops the mouth like a well-fitting winter coat – protection and luxury at the same time. 'Has power' is an understatement. It doesn't just have power, it IS power. But this power is never crude. The oak, oh that wonderful oak, presents itself in its most mature form – not bitter, not tannic, but wise and balanced. The complexity is what elevates this palate from good to extraordinary. While you are still trying to decipher the spice, the next wave of flavours has already built up. Fruit mingles with wood, sweetness with tartness, creaminess with precision. It's like reading a good novel – each page reveals new nuances without losing the thread.","He stays, takes a book from your shelf, sits down in your best armchair and makes himself comfortable. The soft oak – and here its true age shows – dominates, but with the gentleness of an old sage who imparts his lessons without raising his voice. A hint of iodine creeps in, unexpected for a Speysider, but welcome – a maritime whisper amidst the landlocked elegance.

There is no lack of different impressions in the taste. There are malty-sweet and vanilla aromas, as well as salty and peppery-sharp moments. We also recognise the pear from the nose.

Extremely maritime, mineral and unmistakably Talisker.","From the very first nosing, it becomes clear that someone has captured the sea and put it in a bottle. The nose is extremely maritime - and that is an understatement. Seaweed that remains on the beach at low tide mixes with flavours that are actually reminiscent of seafood. Marcel even spoke of 'fossils' - and this description hits the nail on the head. Cold smoke wafts over, as if you were standing on a Scottish beach while a peat fire smoulders in the distance. Chalky notes give the whole thing a mineral base, which is rounded off by subtle vanilla tones and fresh lemon zest.","In the mouth, the Tidal Churn unfolds its full geological complexity. Plenty of pepper provides the initial wake-up call, followed by a salty wave that is typical of every good Talisker. But then things get interesting: clear mineral notes dominate the flavour, supported by aromas of fresh bread. The flavours reminiscent of pebbles, limestone and fossils are particularly fascinating. This may sound abstract at first, but anyone who gets involved will understand: This whisky really does taste like the history of the earth. Apple and pear fruit provide a pleasant counterpoint to the basic mineral structure and prevent the whole thing from becoming too stony.","The finish is dry and smoky - classic Talisker characteristics that are particularly striking here. The famous chilli catch, for which the distillery is known, appears in the form of white pepper, which lingers on the tongue for a long time.",https://thewhiskyedition.com/talisker-8-year-old-tidal-churn-diageo-special-releases-2024,admin,"""2025-10-10T15:36:38.070Z""","""2025-10-10T15:36:38.070Z""",https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/talisker-8-year-old-tidal-churn-diageo-special-releases-2024.png

Simply a Talisker.","The taste is probably best described as red wine barrels on a pirate ship.

But a somewhat younger representative. Instead of deep, heavy smoke, you get a gentle peaty note that is more reminiscent of a distant campfire on the beach. This is joined by white pepper, classic bourbon cask notes such as vanilla, caramel and toffee as well as an interesting salty sea breeze. A slight seaweed note resonates, and on top of that there is a pinch of BBQ peanuts and a hint of honey. All in all, a round but somewhat lighter nose that makes you want to take your first sip.","The first sip makes it clear that Talisker Skye is going its own way. Surprisingly, a clear peach note appears first, which is almost tropical. Then comes a slightly bitter spiciness, which is accompanied by oak and a salty, maritime freshness. The mouthfeel is quite creamy, which makes the whisky pleasantly smooth. Spicy accents of rye bread and a slight sharpness provide a nice counterbalance to the fruity sweetness.","This shows that the Talisker Skye is younger than its 10-year-old brother. The finish is rather short, but still remains interesting. A mineral note, paired with the typical Talisker salinity, dominates the finish.

This maritime, salty character is unmistakably Talisker, but subtle enough not to be overwhelming. The smoke is restrained and is more 'warm' than intrusive. Liquorice and honey join in, accompanied by a surprising melon note that gives the whole thing an almost summery freshness. This is maritime elegance without making you feel like you've just nibbled seaweed.","The peat smoke becomes more present, but remains balanced. The maritime saltiness is back - a trademark that makes Talisker so unmistakable. Interestingly, the citrus note changes to a more orangey variant, as if the whisky is maturing as it lingers in the mouth.","The finish is full-bodied and remains true to the Talisker DNA.

In the foreground are honey notes that provide a pleasant sweetness, accompanied by a hay and vanilla flavour that is typical of Speyside whiskies.

An interesting comparison here could be Clynelish, which also has smoky tones, but is much �funkier�. The Tomintoul remains more elegant and accessible.","On the tongue, the Tomintoul 14 year old shows its malty side, with the honey flavour still present and given an additional dimension by the light smoke. The whisky has a heavy, spicy texture, which is in contrast to many fruity, light Speyside whiskies. Interesting notes of apricot brandy and a potato spice mix bring an unexpected spiciness that is rounded off with a hint of mint.","The finish of the single malt is of medium length and remains predominantly spicy and oaky.

With the Vibrant Stills Sauternes Cask 2016/2024, they've once again delivered something exciting. Aged for 8 years � first in ex-bourbon, then in first-fill Sauternes wine casks from France � this release offers bright fruitiness with structure. Bottled exclusively for Germany, it�s definitely worth a closer look.","The nose is fresh, grassy, and green � like a spring meadow somewhere between a lemon grove and a haystack. There�s lime, green grapes, and a hint of nectarine. Dive deeper and you might even discover something like pineapple sponge cake. The wine influence is there, but it leans more bitter than sweet � intriguing!","On the palate, this whisky turns creamy. Nectarine, hints of passionfruit yogurt, and honey meet a surprisingly dry oaky spice. A touch of rye bread, maybe even beer-like notes come through. The fruit fades a little, replaced by structure � although the balance could be better.","The finish is medium, with a gentle tingle and warming feel. There�s a light spice and a hint of oak, but sadly, not much fruit left. It feels like the cask could have given just a bit more.",https://thewhiskyedition.com/wolfburn-vibrant-stills-sauternes-cask-2016-2024-8-year-old,admin,"""2025-10-28T01:28:35.239Z""","""2025-10-28T01:28:35.239Z""",https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/wolfburn-vibrant-stills-sauternes-cask-2016-2024-8-year-old.png
