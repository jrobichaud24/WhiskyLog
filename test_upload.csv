Caol Ila 11 Year Old Ambrosial Feast - Diageo Special Releases 2024	Caol Ila	57.3	90				When Islay forgets its wild side ...	The first sip in the glass is like a walk through an exotic orchard, while a bakery opens its doors in the background. Bright fruity lychee dances with mango, while malty sweetness wraps itself around the senses like a warm cloak. It's as if Islay suddenly wants to play Caribbean. But then - and this is where it gets really interesting - something completely unexpected sneaks up on you: vanilla is paired with sugar beet and yeast, which develops an almost umami-like flavour. White peaches whisper sweet secrets, while hazelnut provides an earthy base that reminds you where you are - on a Scottish island that is normally known for completely different flavours.	The nutty and spicy notes embrace the tongue like old friends, while white pepper provides a surprising spiciness that harmonises perfectly with the 57.30%. Vanilla ice cream - yes, actual vanilla ice cream - melts on the tongue and mingles with yeasty notes so intense that you wonder whether you're tasting a whisky or a craft beer. The hop-like character is so unusual for an Islay whisky that it is almost cheeky. It's as if Caol Ila is saying: 'You think you know me? Then look what else I've got!' A mineral note rounds off the flavour and reminds us that this whisky has not forgotten its Islay roots despite all the rebellion.	Fruity notes interweave with light oak, while the medium length is perfectly measured - not too short to disappoint, not too long to tire. A hint of liquorice and slight dryness with spicy accents ensure a finish that lingers for a long time.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/caol-ila-11-year-old-ambrosial-feast-diageo-special-releases-2024	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:34 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:34 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/caol-ila-11-year-old-ambrosial-feast-diageo-special-releases-2024.png
Fettercairn 4th Release 16 Year Old 2023	Fettercairn	46.4	70				How good is it?	The Fettercairn 16 year old unfolds a true malt bomb on the nose that immediately catches the eye. The intense cereal notes are dominant and are accompanied by a clear, fresh hay flavour - without the horses that nobody likes, but with the pleasant freshness of a well-kept stable. A sweet hint of apple sauce and honey brings a pleasant fruitiness, while pineapple and custard powder provide additional exotic and creamy notes.	On the palate, the Highland whisky has a seductive fig note and a mix of exotic fruits that provide an intense sweetness. The toasted oak brings a complex, woody depth and elegantly complements the flavour experience. The balance between fruitiness and oak is remarkable and gives the whisky a balanced yet exciting flavour.	The finish of the Fettercairn 16 Year Old is long and round, leaving a lasting impression. The bitter oak provides an interesting twist, while ginger, banana, cocoa sultana and walnut offer a rich and complex finish. This finish is both warm and layered, rounding off the experience in an impressive way.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/fettercairn-16-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:53 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:53 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/fettercairn-16-2022.png
Royal Brackla 12 Year Old	Royal Brackla	40	64				This spicy Highland malt shows a surprising amount of character at only 40%!	There is more going on here than you would expect at 40 per cent. A marvellous aroma of dark plums rises to the nose, accompanied by a pleasant hint of cocoa. This is accompanied by slightly leathery nuances - not necessarily what you would expect after a wellness weekend, but certainly full of character. There is a hint of something musty, which gives the whole thing an earthy depth. Most interesting, however, are the pickled red fruits, which smell like a well-stocked jam jar from grandma's pantry.	Black pepper dominates the first encounter and makes it clear that this Highland malt makes no compromises. Nutmeg joins the mix and creates a thoroughly spicy mood. If you like it mild, you should perhaps try a Glenfiddich 12 first - this Royal Brackla means business. Sultanas and prunes bring a pleasant sweetness into play, but it never dominates. It's as if someone has added a generous helping of spices to a clay pot full of pickled fruit. This combination works surprisingly well and gives the whisky a nice complexity.	The finish is quite dry and warming - exactly what you want after a long day. The Royal Brackla finishes with a medium length and shows its peppery side once again. At the end, light fruit orient spices come to the fore again, giving the whole thing a nice finish.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/royal-brackla-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:37 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:37 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/royal-brackla-12-year-old.png
Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie	Bruichladdich	50	39				How good is it?	The number of different casks involved is immediately noticeable. The Scotch releases aromas of sugar syrup and caramel paired with vanilla, honey and white chocolate. Freshly mown grass, further floral notes and spicy oak notes resonate. Here and there, dark berries can be sensed.	Spicy, vanilla, sweet with a bit of nuttiness. The three-stage development of the Classic Laddie is interesting to observe. In the first stage, vanilla, brown sugar and honey spread out. The second stage moves into Brazil nuts and walnuts, lightly salted with a little crispbread and crunchy cereals. Finally, in the third stage, there is a bit of bitterness that we can't quite put our finger on - perhaps red wine.	The medium-long finish also develops in the throat. Beginning in the sweetish area, it turns into a spicy-soft combination to finally flash lightly fruity nuances.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/bruichladdich-classic-laddie-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:53 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:53 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/bruichladdich-classic-laddie.png
Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old	Dalwhinnie	43	34				How good is it?	Very floral with lots of vanilla and blossom honey, the Highlander opens soft and fresh. Very citrusy and tartly acidic, the sweetness is embraced. We are not quite sure whether a slight smoky note is resonating or not.	Like the nose, the scotch is fruity and mild. Low-fat curd (sour, dry) pairs with honey and oatmeal. Here and there we still perceive a little wood. Smoke is also present - or is it?	The Dalwhinnie 15 year finishes with a short, slightly bitter aftertaste.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/dalwhinnie-15-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:48 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:48 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/dalwhinnie-15.png
Wolfburn Cognac Cask 2017/2025 8 Year Old	Wolfburn	46	63				When the north of Scotland kisses cognac.	A warm, soft start. Grapes and sultanas envelop the nose like the first breath in an old wine cellar. Lots of honey, buttered toast, a hint of milk chocolate and a surprising funky twist - almost like mango chutney on warm bread. Malty and inviting, with a clear cognac echo. The nose is the big highlight: round, expressive, slightly playful.	The Wolfburn is softer on the palate. Almond and honey lead the way, carried by cognac sweetness and light oak. That butter toast note again, a trademark that runs throughout. It is round, pleasantly fruity and surprisingly smooth despite being 46%. However, the body remains rather delicate - a little more depth would have been good here. Nevertheless, the balance between fruit, sweetness and malt is finely struck	The medium-long finish brings vanilla and green tea, with a hint of bitter oak. A slightly dry finish, malty and delicately bitter. Not a dramatic finish, rather a quiet ending.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/wolfburn-cognac-cask-2017-2025-8-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:43 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:43 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/wolfburn-cognac-cask-2017-2025-8-year-old.png
Ledaig and Tobermory 2024 18 Year Old - Living Souls	Tobermory	41	107				Ledaig is the brand from the Tobermory distillery that stands for distinctive smoke, Tobermory for maritime elegance - but what happens when the two come together? The Living Souls Ledaig & Tobermory 2024, matured for 18 years, combines precisely these opposites and creates an exciting variety of flavours. Is this a smoky powerhouse or a finely balanced composition?	The first impression: earthy, cold smoke, as if a burnt-out campfire had been left on a damp meadow. This is joined by spicy heather and old forest honey, which gives the fragrance a pleasant depth. There are subtle flashes of vanilla and a hint of ripe apple in the background. Interestingly, there is even a subtle hint of camembert - an unusual but exciting detail.	The attack is creamy and gentle, almost surprisingly soft. Maritime notes resonate, accompanied by lemongrass and a subtle freshness. The smoke is present, but rather restrained - not the rough peaty club, but a subtle, ashy veil. A slight rubbery note comes through, reminiscent of young Islay whiskies, but it remains in the background. Some tequila-like spice and sea salt round off the experience.	The finish is of medium length and again shows the typical ashy notes of a mature Ledaig. There are also gentle oak tones and a subtle aftertaste of apple and pear.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ledaig-2024-18-year-old-living-souls	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ledaig-2024-18-year-old-living-souls.png
Blair Athol 9 Year Old 2014/2023 - Signatory Vintage	Blair Athol	57.1	45				How good is it?	Wow. That's exciting. Cough syrup, eucalyptus and Ricola Swiss herbal sweets are the dominant aromas on the nose, followed by coffee, leather and blackcurrant. If that wasn't enough, we also smell a good portion of liquorice. All extremely intense.	Clearly 99.9% dark chocolate paired with freshly ground coffee, tobacco (almost ashy) and rubber. The herbal and cough syrupy notes are also present in the flavour. On the fruity side, we taste a few plums. The whole flavour is overwhelming (both positively and negatively), intense, dry and extremely full-bodied.	The long, smooth finish is characterised by tobacco, pepper, leather and burnt oak.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/blair-athol-9-years-old-100-proof-signatory-vintage	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:22 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:22 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/blair-athol-9-100-proof-signatory-vintage.png
Oban The Macleans Young Teddy (2023)	Oban	50.8	379				Whiskies tell stories. Some shout, with drums and fanfare. Others whisper – and yet their echoes linger in memory. Oban The Macleans Young Teddy (2023) belongs to the latter. A limited edition from the storied Oban Distillery in the Scottish Highlands – boldly bottled at 50.8% ABV, but without an age statement. And perhaps that’s the first clue: this whisky doesn’t aim to impress with numbers but with character.	The first impression is unusually familiar. Malty at the core – like opening a box of cereal on a quiet Sunday morning. But before you settle into comfort, complexity kicks in like a double-decker bus to the sinuses: Pear, apricot, mirabelle – bright, juicy, almost crystalline. Caramel reminiscent of soft fudge. Then, a full-on patisserie parade: buttery croissant, biscuit dough, strawberry tartlet – it’s a Parisian brunch on a balcony. A whisper of white tea? Yes. Subtly floral with a delicate astringency.	The arrival is: creamy, almost viscous. 'Indefinably light-fruited” may sound like a cop-out – but it’s the most honest descriptor. Like a beam of light through fog – you sense it, but can’t grasp it. Then comes white pepper, sharp but not harsh. A hint of leather? Maybe. Wet coffee grounds – earthy, dark, damp. Oddly compelling. And just a hint of green tobacco, freshly cut, almost chlorophyllic. A sensory collage that refuses linearity – and yet remains surprisingly balanced.	The finish is the bridge back to reality – but it doesn’t let you leave easily. There’s good oak, but no bitterness. A little caramel, some honey, and then – cheekily – a salty kiss. Maritime, but not stormy. You sense that a sherry cask was somewhere in the process – but only briefly. Maybe the whisky just waved hello as it passed by. Different? Yes. Bizarre? No. It’s got angles, but no harsh edges.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/oban-the-macleans-young-teddy-2023-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:23 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:23 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/oban-the-macleans-young-teddy-2023.png

North British 15 Year Old 2003 Mossburn No. 24	North British	46	46				How good is it?	Hay-like and smelling of fresh straw, we can't help but think of a mown meadow. Notes of fresh, juicy grass and a flower meadow are also recognisable. Dominant is a sugary sweetness of white chocolate that coats the other aromas.	The 15-year-old single grain whisky opens really delicately. Matured in American hogsheads, it brings vanilla, lots - really lots - of sugar and a little oak. Almost sugar syrup. A little deeper lies a slightly peppery spice that sets a nice accent.	The medium-long finish coats the palate with a crust of sugar. A small acidic touch is also noticeable.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/north-british-15-year-old-2003-mossburn	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:06 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:06 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/north-british-15.png
Teaninich 2016/2023 - Sansibar	Teaninich	60.2	79				How good is it?	From the very first sniff, you realise that this is not a typical Highland whisky. Instead of heavy sherry or smoky notes, you get a surprisingly fresh and light fruity nose. Vanilla and citrus are in the foreground, accompanied by a fine herbal note reminiscent of herbal tea. The alcohol is noticeable, but not disturbing - you realise that the whisky has strength. All in all, a very exciting, lively flavour!	The first sip brings with it an oily, almost syrupy texture. In terms of flavour, it starts with a clear vanilla note before fresh lemon and apricot come into play. Then it becomes more exotic: a hint of rose water provides a slightly floral note. The wood is also noticeable, but without overwhelming the whisky. The honey sweetness provides balance, but the strength of the high alcohol content is always present. A small drop of water can help to develop the flavours even better.	The finish is medium to long, but not quite as harmonious as hoped. The fresh wood remains in the foreground, accompanied by a slight bitterness that makes the whisky appear somewhat unrounded.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/teaninich-2016-2023-sansibar-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:35 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:35 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/teaninich-2016-2023-sansibar.png
Bunnahabhain Stiuireadair	Bunnahabhain	46.3	33				How good is it?	Sweet, really sweet, really really sweet. We think of prunes and buttered speculoos. Behind the dried fruit hides an interesting variety of aromas. Once the nose has become accustomed to the dark dried fruit, vanilla and caramel notes resonate and later the salty-maritime character also appears.	'There greets the sea: as if you gargled a good sip of seawater.' Sweet on the lips, salty on the palate we again have dried fruit and strong nutty aromas. Compared to the nose, the ratio is exactly reversed. The salty-maritime clearly predominates and the sherry flavors remain in the background. There is also a hint of nutty chocolate and dried apricot.	The long finish is very dry. A slight fruitiness remains and is again accompanied by a salty feeling.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/bunnahabhain-stiuireadair-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/bunnahabhain-stiuireadair.png
Speyburn 16 Year Old	Speyburn	43	38				How good is it?	From the very first sniff, you get the feeling that it could be something after all. The aromas of ripe peaches and oranges almost jump out at you, accompanied by a pleasant sweetness reminiscent of honey and vanilla. A hint of almond and white chocolate lend the whole thing an almost seductive note. But beware: the fragrance promises more than the whisky can deliver.	The promising aroma is followed by disillusionment. In the mouth, the Speyburn 16 year old is unfortunately more watery than hoped for, which is rather disappointing for a 16 year old whisky. Yes, there are spices such as pepper and oak, but they are more intrusive than balanced. The sweetness of honey and white chocolate comes through, but struggles in vain against the excess of old wood and the surprisingly flat structure. A hint of pear and apple tries to turn the tide, but it remains a desperate attempt.	But the finish saves? Unfortunately not. Medium-long and quickly forgotten, one thing above all remains in the memory: oak spice, a little pepper, a hint of vanilla and, at the very end, a subtle hazelnut note. But even here the experience is rather flat and not very complex.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/speyburn-16-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:49 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:49 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/speyburn-16-travel-exclusive.png
Ardbeg An Oa	Ardbeg	46.6	50				How good is it?	Tobacco smoke, albeit slightly fruity. In the background we find a lot of subtle aromas - could be an orange or a peach. The creamy caramel that follows is joined by pine resin and wood shavings.	At first, we think of grilled vegetables, black tea and tobacco. An interesting combination. Further on, smoked ham, oak and fruitiness are perceptible. The oily mouthfeel is characterised by the ashes of an extinguished campfire.	Long, as is usual for an Ardbeg, we have an intensely smoky and very smooth and balanced finish that leaves us tasting smoked ham again.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ardbeg-an-oa-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:12 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:12 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ardbeg-an-oa.png
Ben Nevis 1996/2020 24 Year Old - Sansibar	Ben Nevis	43.9	199				Ben Nevis is a distillery that is no longer an insider tip among connoisseurs. Independent bottlings in particular often enjoy a certain reputation, as they reveal interesting facets of this Highland distillery. Today we have a 24-year-old Ben Nevis from Zanzibar in our glass - a bottling with character?	The nose welcomes us with a surprising lightness. Floral notes mingle with a gentle vanilla sweetness, accompanied by malty undertones and a hint of foliage. Gentle herbal flavours also resonate, giving the whisky a certain depth. The oak remains discreetly in the background - present, but by no means intrusive.	Here the Ben Nevis shows a completely different side. The oak is now clearly evident and brings a lovely spiciness with it. At the same time, a pleasant sweetness pushes forward - candy floss and a hint of stevia provide a slightly playful sweetness that harmonises wonderfully with the malty notes. An interesting contrast between strength and elegance.	The finish is of medium length and remains pleasantly warming on the tongue. The oak remains present without dominating. Not a dramatic finish, but a solid and pleasantly balanced end.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ben-nevis-1996-2020-24-year-old-sansibar	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:34 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:34 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ben-nevis-1996-2020-24-year-old-sansibar.png

Benrinnes 15 Year Old 2008/2023 - Malts of Scotland	Benrinnes	56.4	89				How good is it?	Nosing the Benrinnes 15 Year Old is an exciting journey through the sherry hogshead. The maltiness and almost extreme cereal notes form the basis, while fruity nuances of blackberry, redcurrant, cranberry and damson unfold. A hint of dark chocolate and subtle roasted flavours round things off.	The single malt with malt from Roseisle Maltings presents a strong spiciness and earthy depth on the palate. Notes of tobacco and sweet plums mingle with morello cherries and a kick of colourful pepper. The molasses, reminiscent of honey BBQ, lends the flavour a sweet intensity. We can't help but think a little of an old-man's room - the Speysider has a slight leathery, mouldy quality to it.	The finish of this single malt is tinglingly spicy, short to medium in length and characterised by intense oak. Leathery nuances combine with a hint of chilli chocolate and leave a lasting, multi-faceted impression.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/benrinnes-15-year-old-2008-2023-malts-of-scotland	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:27 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:27 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/benrinnes-15-2008-2023-malts-of-scotland.png
Glen Ord 2011/2021 10 Year Old - van Wees	Glen Ord	46	49				The perfect entry-level Highland whisky with a mild sweetness and clean distillation. Oatmeal, unripe bananas and subtle spice – technically flawless, but not challenging.	The olfactory analysis immediately reveals the characteristic Glen Ord DNA: a distinctly cereal-based structure dominates, with oatmeal notes forming the primary aroma structure. These cereal components are created by Glen Ord's specific mashing process at a mash temperature of 63-65°C, which ensures optimal starch conversion with minimal tannin extraction. Secondary fruit esters present themselves in the form of unripe banana notes – a typical characteristic of relatively young Highland distillates matured in ex-bourbon casks. Traces of vanilla, attributable to lignin degradation in American oak, support the aroma profile, while subtle citrus and pineapple components indicate clean fermentation with controlled ester formation processes. Peach notes complete the fruit spectrum and are created by specific acetates that are favoured by Glen Ord's moderate distillation temperatures.	The technical precision of Glen Ord's distillation process is evident on the palate: a remarkably mild texture with a malty-sweet base structure dominates the mouthfeel. The sweetness results from residual sugars and glycerine compounds, which are preserved by the gentle distillation in Glen Ord's copper pot stills. Lightly perfumed notes – probably terpenic compounds from the new make spirit – give the whisky a floral dimension without being intrusive. White toast character shows moderate cask integration: the American oak has imparted its primary vanillin and tannins without dominating. A subtle saltiness, possibly from coastal storage in the Highlands, balances the sweetness and enhances the pear fruitiness. The texture is remarkably smooth – an indicator of clean distillation without sulphur compounds or fusel oils. This 'ironed' characteristic speaks for excellent technical control throughout the production chain.	The finish is deliberately restrained – a technical decision that is typical for 46% ABV and 10 years of maturation. A barely perceptible finish with minimal wood tannins indicates first-fill American oak casks that have already released their most aggressive components to previous contents. Slight dryness and spicy notes develop gradually, revealing the beginnings of a complexity that would become more intense with longer storage. This subtle development is characteristic of mid-aged Highland distillates.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-ord-2011-2021-10-year-old-van-wees-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-ord-2011-2021-10-year-old-van-wees.png
Bruichladdich 1991 31 Year Old - Ralph Steadman X Cask 88	Bruichladdich	50.6	662				Drink or collect? We have the answer.	Even the first impression is like a gust of salty wind over a freshly harvested field. Maritime notes mingle with oak, vanilla and honey, while gentle flavours of grain, lemon and exotic papaya unfold underneath. Here an old cask speaks with a dignified voice - soft but complex, never loud but full of depth.	The attack is creamy, almost oily, with a surprising lightness for its 50.6% vol. The flavour is reminiscent of lemon sweets and sugar syrup, followed by old oak and a hint of sweet malt, which elegantly picks up on the connection to the malt theme. Unripe mango provides a fruity counterpoint - an exciting interplay between youth and maturity, between structure and playfulness.	Long, spicy and steeped in oak. The finish is dry, with black pepper, a hint of burnt toast and a bittersweet flicker of honey and candy floss. Here the bourbon barrel resounds one last time - powerful, venerable, almost majestic.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/bruichladdich-1991-31-year-old-ralph-steadman-x-cask-88-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:30 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:30 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/bruichladdich-1991-31-year-old-ralph-steadman-x-cask-88.png
Glen Scotia Double Cask	Glen Scotia	46	33				How good is it?	More intense than expected. Honey, vanilla, candied fruits, as you know them from the fair and a bunch of peach. If the whisky lingers a little in the glass, we perceive hints of leather (yes, exactly the section for leather shoes in the shoe shop), herbs and clear sherry notes. A floral note, as well as something woody, which is more reminiscent of a burnt match, can also be detected.	Dry - really dust-dry - a lot of spicy oak lies mouth-filling in the foreground. Left and right we find a bit of cinnamon, some peanuts, dried fruit (dates, apricots and peach) and a dominant vanilla.	The finish drags - like chewing gum - spicy-intense, as well as earthy-leathery and has a dominant note of Swiss herbal bonbons.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-scotia-double-cask-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:01 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:01 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-scotia-double-cask.png
Bruichladdich 1993/2023 30 Year Old - Malts of Scotland	Bruichladdich	45.8	489				Islay without peat, but full of depth. Those familiar with older Bruichladdich expressions know this distillery offers not smoke, but structure, elegance, and a quiet strength. Independent bottler Malts of Scotland has secured a venerable bourbon barrel from 1993 – and with it, shows what time can do to a fine single malt. Matured for 30 years on the Isle of Islay, bottled at 45.8% ABV, non-chill filtered and natural in colour.	The nose unfolds with a beautifully layered complexity. Tropical fruits glide gently into the scene – mango, pineapple, dragon fruit – accompanied by soft cotton candy and delicate honey. A subtle oak note lingers in the background, tied together with cereal, Bircher muesli and almond milk. There’s even a light nuttiness reminiscent of trail mix. This is old-school Bruichladdich at its best: multifaceted, elegant, never overpowering.	The first sip confirms the promise: a textbook mature bourbon cask. Again, tropical fruit – mango and papaya now – paired with oats, cereals, and subtle chia or psyllium seed notes, evoking a modern breakfast bowl. It may sound unusual, but it works perfectly with the soft sweetness and malty core. With the second sip, the spice arrives: robust, mature oak, dry and assertive but never bitter. A persistent sweetness remains – somewhere between a fruity granola bar and sun-ripened fruit.	The finish is medium in length, oaky and spicy, with a hint of vanilla and a flash of apple. Compared to the beautifully expressive nose and palate, the finish feels a touch simpler, more on the dry side. Not weak – far from it – but more restrained. In a whisky of this quality, that makes it the 'least strong” part, which still means 'very good.”	https://thewhiskyedition.com/bruichladdich-1993-2023-30-year-old-malts-of-scotland	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:04 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:04 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/bruichladdich-1993-2023-30-year-old-malts-of-scotland.png
Glenglassaugh 8 Year Old 2013/2022 - The Cask Wizard	Glenglassaugh	47.3	80				How good is it?	The nose opens with a caramel cherry-berry mix. Sweetish, like sugar syrup, wine gums and a little apple lie on the surface. Digging a little deeper, we find herbal and floral notes that make us think of buttercup and sage. Hazelnut is also present. Versatile and exciting!	Matching the nose, we also find caramel and wine gum in the taste. However, the initial sweetness then splits into two directions. On the outside, we find slightly peppery notes that linger for a long time. Further inside, there is hazelnut again, accompanied by almonds and a dry, herbal green tea note.	The medium-long finish is distinctly more astringent with an oaky spiciness and a special note reminiscent of wet driftwood.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/the-cask-wizard-glenglassaugh-8-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:51 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:51 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/the-cask-wizard-glenglassaugh-8.png
Blair Athol 10 Year Old 2007/2019 - Douglas Laing	Blair Athol	46	47				How good is it?	On the nose, the Single Malt is soft and sweet. We think of freshly baked butter cake. This is joined by notes of vanilla, honey and oats. The aroma is rounded off by a pleasant maltiness complemented by cereals.	On the palate, the Blair Athol is not as soft as the nose suggested. Caramel toffee, honey and vanilla are joined by surprisingly spicy flavours. Intense oak leaves a distinct tingle on the tongue despite the creamy mouthfeel. Despite its age, the spiciness verges on light ethanol pepperiness.	The medium-long finish is also dominated by toasted oak spice. This leaves a clear bitterness on the palate. Behind this, there is still some grain and hints of dark chocolate.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/provenance-blair-athol-2010-10-douglas-laing-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:51 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:51 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/provenance-blair-athol-2010-10-douglas-laing.png
Macallan 2003/2023 20 Year Old Speymalt - Gordon & MacPhail	Macallan	58.3	375				When a legend like Macallan meets the expertise of independent bottler Gordon & MacPhail, one thing is certain: the result has the potential to set new standards. The Macallan 2003/2023 Speymalt, a 20-year-old single malt, is no exception. At a whopping 58.30 % vol., this sherry bomb from Speyside is powerful and complex. But does it live up to its promise?	This whisky doesn't mince its words from the very first nosing. What emerges from the glass is a true sherry grenade. A heavy, almost dramatic combination of wet carpet, leather and tobacco meets the autumnal freshness of damp leaves. This is joined by the sweet darkness of burnt caramel. It is a fragrance that tells stories - smoky, earthy and deeply rooted in decades of ageing.	The true magic of this whisky unfolds on the tongue. The first thing you notice is a distinctive dryness reminiscent of a fine sherry. This is accompanied by an amazingly oily texture that takes over the entire mouth. The flavours are intense and clear: fig, rich and dark, is accompanied by earthy leather and bitter cocoa. There is no room for restraint here - this whisky has character and shows it.	The finish is the icing on the cake of this complex drop. It is long, as befits a whisky aged for 20 years, and has a lovely spiciness that finishes astringent and dry. But before it disappears, a slight fruity sweetness flashes through.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/macallan-2003-2023-20-year-old-gordon-amp-macphail	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/macallan-2003-2023-20-year-old-gordon-macphail.png
Talisker 8 Year Old Tidal Churn - Diageo Special Releases 2024	Talisker	58.7	83				When fossils speak in whisky! Extremely maritime, mineral and unmistakably Talisker.	From the very first nosing, it becomes clear that someone has captured the sea and put it in a bottle. The nose is extremely maritime - and that is an understatement. Seaweed that remains on the beach at low tide mixes with flavours that are actually reminiscent of seafood. Marcel even spoke of 'fossils' - and this description hits the nail on the head. Cold smoke wafts over, as if you were standing on a Scottish beach while a peat fire smoulders in the distance. Chalky notes give the whole thing a mineral base, which is rounded off by subtle vanilla tones and fresh lemon zest.	In the mouth, the Tidal Churn unfolds its full geological complexity. Plenty of pepper provides the initial wake-up call, followed by a salty wave that is typical of every good Talisker. But then things get interesting: clear mineral notes dominate the flavour, supported by aromas of fresh bread. The flavours reminiscent of pebbles, limestone and fossils are particularly fascinating. This may sound abstract at first, but anyone who gets involved will understand: This whisky really does taste like the history of the earth. Apple and pear fruit provide a pleasant counterpoint to the basic mineral structure and prevent the whole thing from becoming too stony.	The finish is dry and smoky - classic Talisker characteristics that are particularly striking here. The famous chilli catch, for which the distillery is known, appears in the form of white pepper, which lingers on the tongue for a long time.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/talisker-8-year-old-tidal-churn-diageo-special-releases-2024	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:38 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:38 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/talisker-8-year-old-tidal-churn-diageo-special-releases-2024.png
Talisker Storm	Talisker	45.8	31				The balanced single malt combines salty sea flavours with warm smoke.	The nose starts with a real citrus-vanilla bomb that immediately reminds me of sunny moments on the Isle of Skye - if they even exist there. This maritime, salty character is unmistakably Talisker, but subtle enough not to be overwhelming. The smoke is restrained and is more 'warm' than intrusive. Liquorice and honey join in, accompanied by a surprising melon note that gives the whole thing an almost summery freshness. This is maritime elegance without making you feel like you've just nibbled seaweed.	The peat smoke becomes more present, but remains balanced. The maritime saltiness is back - a trademark that makes Talisker so unmistakable. Interestingly, the citrus note changes to a more orangey variant, as if the whisky is maturing as it lingers in the mouth.	The finish is full-bodied and remains true to the Talisker DNA. The smoke envelops the tongue, but the famous 'Talisker kick' - that peppery aftertaste that normally conquers the throat - is noticeably muted. This is definitely a positive aspect and makes the Storm more accessible for beginners.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/talisker-storm-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:29 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:29 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/talisker-storm.png
Longmorn 11 Year Old 2014/2025 - James Eadie	Longmorn	52.4	90				An exceptional Speyside single malt with complex aromas ranging from vanilla to peach.	The nose is dominated by bright, ripe fruit – a blend of juicy pears and yellow apples reminiscent of a sunny autumn day in the orchard. These fresh fruit notes are elegantly accompanied by creamy custard buns, whose warm sweetness creates a cosy atmosphere. Particularly noteworthy is the pronounced vanilla note that runs like a golden thread through the entire aroma profile. This is joined by subtle notes of white tea and white peach, which only fully unfold after a few minutes in the glass.	The first impression is dominated by creamy honey, which coats the tongue like velvet and creates a luxurious foundation. The waxy notes are reminiscent of a Clynelish and blend harmoniously with the aforementioned vanilla to create a veritable taste experience. Fresh grape notes are surprisingly distinct, while a warm cinnamon note provides the necessary spice and, accompanied by aromas of burnt toast, adds a rustic, almost bakery-like dimension.	The finish of this exceptional Longmorn is characterised by a surprising abundance of soft wood notes, which clearly demonstrate how well the distillate has harmonised with the casks. Exotic pineapple notes bring a tropical dimension into play and remind us that great whiskies are always good for surprises. The creamy honey on the palate lingers, ensuring a long-lasting, sweet finish. The finish is rounded off by a slightly perfumed note that is elegant and never intrusive.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/longmorn-11-year-old-2014-2025-james-eadie	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/longmorn-11-year-old-2014-2025-james-eadie.png
Ardbeg Wee Beastie 5 Year Old	Ardbeg	47.4	40				How good is it?	We smell vinegary acidity, black pepper and strong sweet tobacco smoke. The combination somehow reminds us of the rubber of bicycle tyres that have just ridden through barbecue sauce. A little salty liquorice and vanilla bean shine through.	Darkly burnt smoked bacon with a little sugar first hit the tongue. In the middle are tar, leather and intense peat smoke. As in the nose, saltiness and a nuance of vanilla also resonate here.	A dry, peaty something lingers forever in the aftertaste.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ardbeg-wee-beastie-5-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ardbeg-wee-beastie-5.png
Blair Athol 11 Year Old 2009/2021 - The Old Friends	Blair Athol	54	75				How good is it?	Right from the start, this malt reveals itself as exceptionally robust. Intense notes of red fruits like plums and dark grapes take the center stage. Light walnut aromas and subtly charred notes accompany them. Fresh roasted malt, complemented by a discreet leather note and a touch of pepper, round out the flavor profile.	The mouthfeel is immediately extremely oily, caressing the palate intensely. As expected, the taste is powerful but less sweet than the nose might suggest. Dried red fruits, a distinctive leather-tobacco note, and pronounced wine aromas characterize this malt. The whole experience is enveloped by intense tannins.	The finish is medium to long, displaying pronounced oaky spiciness. Reminiscent of mixed peppers, a slight bitterness from the tannins continues to shine.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/the-old-friends-blair-athol-11-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:30 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:30 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/the-old-friends-blair-athol-11.png
Aberfeldy 12 Year Old	Aberfeldy	40	35				How good is it?	The start on the nose is smooth and soft. We first smell sweet honey and the fruitiness of unripe apples and pears. This blends well with hints of lemon zest and sweetened whipped cream. There is almost a waxy texture to the nose.	This single malt is impressively smooth and creamy. We think of cheesecake and sugared quark desserts. There is also a light, fruity acidity that reminds us of the skin of a Granny Smith apple.	The finish is short and crisp. No intense kick, just a light, pleasant oak note to round off the creamy, smooth malt.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/aberfeldy-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:45 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:45 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/aberfeldy-12.png
Tomatin 2006/2024 17 Year Old	Tomatin	46	174				Sometimes, it takes just one moment to capture the essence of a whisky. The Tomatin 2006/2024, aged for 17 years and bottled at 46% ABV, transports you to a world of deep aromas and classic sherry cask intensity. From the moment the bottle is opened, it’s clear that this single malt is a true Highland spirit through and through.	The first impression feels like strolling through a market stall brimming with dried fruits: blended raisins, cranberries, dates, and figs dominate. Sweet notes of caramelized sugar and cinnamon add warmth, while a hint of fresh leather in the rain elevates its complexity.	On the palate, the Tomatin reveals itself as both opulent and refined. The dried fruit notes persist, with raisins and dates taking center stage, accompanied by a subtle touch of chocolate. The texture is intensely oily, almost velvety, ensuring the flavors linger beautifully.	The finish showcases the whisky’s full maturity. Once again, the dried fruits come to the forefront, this time paired with a pleasant dryness of tannins and a distinct oakiness. The long and alluring aftertaste makes for a fitting finale.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tomatin-2006-2024-17-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:52 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:52 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tomatin-2006-2024-17-year-old.png
Tormore 14 Year Old - 82 Chapters to Newcastle	Tormore	61.6	80				How good is it?	Right from the first sniff, a distinct hint of cold smoke emerges. Behind it are the classic Speyside aromas: forest honey and a basket filled with autumnal fruits, including pears and apples. The intense aroma of light fruits is framed by vanilla and nearly-dried grass, akin to 'almost-hay.'	On the palate, this malt makes a strong impression. Surprisingly intense campfire smoke, accompanied by the fruity notes of the familiar fruit basket, with a clear inclination toward dried apples. We also detect a hint of white pepper and a subtle nuttiness. Overall, it offers a beautifully creamy mouthfeel.	The finish is even more pronounced with nutty characteristics, medium-length, and a slight smokiness, providing a delightful conclusion.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/82-chapters-to-new-castle-tormore-14-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:36 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:36 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/82-chapters-to-new-castle-tormore-14.png
Dailuaine 2012/2022 - Malts of Scotland	Dailuaine	57.1	78				How good is it?	The Dailuaine reveals its complexity from the very first inhalation. A malty base is accompanied by sultanas soaked in rum and a hint of cream and custard. The fragrance is dense and rich, almost heavy. Another inhale and the flavours of buttery red apple crumble, pear and peach syrup emerge. The olfactory experience is rounded off with notes of honey, pear and butter biscuits. A hint of cream caramel and sultanas gives the whisky a pleasant sweetness, which is complemented by hints of apple sauce, vanilla and coconut shell.	On the palate, the Single Malt unfolds with an oily, rich texture. The interplay of apple-pear compote and vanilla custard forms the prelude, followed by a subtle herbal note and a hint of wine gum. The lemon zest adds a refreshing citrus note that harmonises perfectly with the buttery apple crumble. White grape, rum and stewed pear contribute to the fruity depth, while hints of varnished wood and ginger add a spicy complexity. This bottling offers a rare balance between fruit, sweetness and spice that we really like.	The finish of the Speysider is long-lasting and warming. A gentle spiciness, dominated by pepper and ginger, leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Mixed fruits marinated in rum, apple crumble and a subtle woody note round off the experience.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/dailuaine-2012-2022-malts-of-scotland-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:24 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:24 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/dailuaine-2012-2022-malts-of-scotland.png
Talisker x Parley - Wilder Seas - XO Cognac Cask Finish (2023)	Talisker	48.6	36				Whisky with a mission - but where is the wild sea?	From the very first sniff, Wilder Seas greets us with an unexpectedly charming note: subtle smoke meets a warm, sweet wave of cognac. This is joined by a maritime, salty freshness reminiscent of a gentle sea breeze. If you take a closer look, you will find dark berries and a pleasant spiciness. Very pleasant and inviting overall - the wild sea seems to be in the distance here.	You might expect a powerful, harsh storm on the tongue - but instead there is a surprisingly harmonious interplay of sweet smoke, peppery spice and fruity notes. Sweet smoke, not too intrusive, rather warming and soft, plays with salted caramel and plum - a perfect combination of salty sweetness and fruity freshness. Citrus zest and wet wood add a touch of spice and depth, while herbs make a playful appearance here and there.	In keeping with the overall experience, the finish is not a wild storm, but a gentle glide. Very salty, slightly astringent, calm with a hint of seaweed. A beautiful maritime finish that maintains the Talisker DNA.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/talisker-x-parley-wilder-seas-xo-cognac-cask-finish-2023-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:13 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:13 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/talisker-x-parley-wilder-seas-xo-cognac-cask-finish-2023.png
Glenturret 29 Year Old 1987/2017 - Cadenhead's	Glenturret	42.1	140				How good is it?	The very first nose contact leaves no doubt: fruit is the trump card here! Walnut meets a pleasant sweetness of pears and apples, accompanied by creamy vanilla. The flavours are like a freshly picked fruit basket - but nothing is overpowering. The bouquet remains subtle and light, a gentle autumn breeze that promises but does not reveal too much.	The first sip takes the whisky in a completely new direction. ‘Wow, that's so sweet’, you might think - and you wouldn't be wrong. Ripe peaches and other stone fruit flavours dominate at first, before an unexpected spiciness enters the stage. This is joined by a hint of cherry and sour apple rings, reminiscent of carefree childhood days. But before it gets too playful, the oak brings everything into balance: powerful, spicy, almost tannic.	The finish is medium-long, not too short, but not a marathon either. It is pleasantly warming and lingers in the memory with a spicy, rich note. A fine, chalky hint creeps in, reminiscent of cool stone walls or freshly polished chalk.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenturret-29-year-old-1987-2017-cadenheads	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:26 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:26 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenturret-29-yo-1987-2017-cadenheads.png
Glenburgie 1997 24 Year Old - Ralph Steadman X Cask 88	Glenburgie	55.2	352				Drink or collect? We have the answer.	From the very first nosing, it is clear that no expense has been spared here. The whisky opens with an almost classic sherry flavour - sweet, dark, deep. Aromas of sultanas, dates and ripe red fruits rise to the nose, accompanied by delicate notes of plum and a hint of milk chocolate. The slightly tart undertone is interesting, grounding the fragrance and preventing it from tipping over into pompousness.	The picture continues on the palate: dark fruits in a rich guise, plus strong woody notes, some spice and a striking leatheriness. Despite the high alcohol content, the whisky is surprisingly smooth - you almost forget that you are dealing with 55.2 % vol. The structure is soft, but not without backbone. It is a heavy dram, a whisky that demands attention. And this is precisely its strength - and perhaps also its weakness.	After such an intense start, you almost expect a long finish - but this is exactly where Glenburgie surprises. The finish is rather medium in length, characterised by wood spice, a hint of bitterness and leather notes. The sweetness from the start recedes somewhat, with the cask presence dominating instead.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenburgie-1997-24-year-old-ralph-steadman-x-cask-88-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:31 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:31 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenburgie-1997-24-year-old-ralph-steadman-x-cask-88.png

Edradour 2012/2024 12 Year Old Frühburgunder Barrique Finish	Edradour	46	90				When you think of Edradour, sherry bombs and heavy, dark notes come to mind. But wait a minute! The Edradour 2012/2024 Early Burgundy Barrique Finish is ready to throw all clichés overboard. No sherry? WTF, Edradour! But don't worry, this Highland malt surprises in the best possible way.  The colour alone is stunning: an intense rosé that shimmers almost teasingly in the glass. The early Burgundy cask has done a great job here. You could almost think you have a wine in your glass - but don't worry, the 12-year-old whisky remains true to its Scottish roots.	The nose is a real adventure! Strawberries? Check. Red fruits and berries? There too. A vinous bouquet gently reminiscent of a summer evening in Tuscany.  But then comes the surprise: a hint of yoghurt creeps in, paired with a delicate hint of grey bread. Yes, grey bread - and no, that's not a typo. Sounds crazy, but smells brilliant.	With the first sip, you immediately know why this whisky is fun: strawberry yoghurt, sweet and fruity, dominates the start. But before it becomes too sweet, peppery spice and a pleasant dryness bring balance.  Dazu gesellen sich Karamell und Honig – wie ein Werther’s Original, aber mit Stil. Es ist, als würde man sich in einer französischen Patisserie befinden, während ein Highland-Cow einem freundlich zunickt.	The finish is of medium length and is characterised by spicy oak with a subtle winey note, reminiscent of a good glass of red wine. Perfect for anyone who likes to enjoy their whiskies with a touch of elegance.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/edradour-2012-2024-12-year-old-fruehburgunder-barrique-finish-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/edradour-2012-2024-12-year-old-fruehburgunder-barrique-finish.png
Aultmore 13 Year Old - 82 Chapters to Newcastle	Aultmore	57.4	90				How good is it?	Unexpectedly, we first perceive pear, closely followed by a combination of cherries, currants, dates and plums. The heavy aroma is accompanied by Christmas spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg and a hint of clove. The composition is rounded off by a certain oak spiciness.	Whew! This is sweet. If we had expected a slightly sour base, we are surprised by a decent fruit sweetness with a combination of sugar syrup and wild berries, which, however, later turns into a sour-grapey and very mouthwatering note. The oily single malt also impresses in the mouth with Christmas spices, dates and plums. The 57.4% abv. are very well incorporated, yet the Scotch could do with a few drops of water to open up the flavours further. All in all harmonious, multi-layered and pleasant, even if surprisingly sweet.	Long and dry, the Aultmore from the red wine cask remains with wild berries, dark chocolate and an underlying oak spiciness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/82-chapters-to-new-castle-aultmore-13-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:56 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:56 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/82-chapters-to-new-castle-aultmore-11.png
Glenturret 12 Year Old Release 2024	Glenturret	46.4	69				The Glenturret 12 Years 2024 can be seen as the 'big brother' of the Triple Wood 2024. With a clear age statement and a noticeably richer color, this whisky promises more depth and structure. Bottled at 46.4% ABV, it brings a combination of spice, fruitiness, and a creamy texture.	Right from the start, it's clear that this whisky is a more refined and complex version of the Triple Wood. Cinnamon and oak set striking accents, accompanied by dark berries and a hint of dark chocolate. An inviting graininess adds warmth, while vanilla provides a subtle creamy sweetness.	The initial impression is wonderfully creamy, followed by a pronounced spiciness. The oak imparts a pleasant depth, while cinnamon and sugar resemble an intensely dark, caramelized pastry. Dark currants bring a fruity note, well-balanced by a light acidity. Overall, a powerful and well-structured taste that skillfully blends spice and sweetness.	The finish remains pleasantly soft and subtly oak-driven. A warming note runs throughout, accompanied by fruity sweetness and a distinct cinnamon spice. Light spice notes add a fine complexity, while the balance between wood and fruit remains intact.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenturret-12-year-old-release-2024-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenturret-12-year-old-release-2024.png
The Singleton Of Dufftown 12 Year Old	Dufftown	40	28				How good is it?	As expected, the 'Luscious Nectar' smells malty-sweet, fruity, slightly honeyed perhaps and very soft. Other aromas we detect are nuts and latte, as well as green apple. Really pleasant.	Thin, delicate and oily, the whisky floats in the mouth and tingles a little on the tongue. The fruitiness is pronounced here, as well. The apple in particular stands out. Orange toffee, roasted nuts and brown sugar round off the less complex but quaffable single malt. Every now and then, the alcohol bites a little, despite the low 40% abv.	The finish is rather short and combines sweet cane sugar syrup with slightly more dominant oaky bitterness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/the-singleton-of-dufftown-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/the-singleton-of-dufftown-12.png
Glenlivet 12 Year Old Double Oak	Glenlivet	40	33				How good is it?	Right from the start, the aroma is classic Speyside. White bread and vanilla open with a hint of honey and crisp apples. Primarily fruity and sweet, more exotic notes of pineapple also emerge. A light citrus note evokes the image of freeze-dried lemon herbal tea in our minds.	The taste delivers exactly what the nose promises. We find the sweetness of green fruit, along with some floral aromas, flattering honey, and intense vanilla. The mouthfeel is creamy and buttery soft. On the palate, a light citrus note and the tingling sensation of ginger tea spread.	The finish is short to medium-length and dominated by roasted oak and nuttiness. Once again, we find subtle ginger notes. The Single Malt is rounded off by some spice and pleasant maltiness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenlivet-12-year-old-double-oak	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:33 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:33 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenlivet-12-double-oak.png
Wolfburn Vibrant Stills Bourbon Barrel 2015/2023 8 Year Old	Wolfburn	50	79				The Vibrant Stills Bourbon Barrel 2015/2023 edition by Wolfburn is a small batch release made exclusively for the German market. Aged for 8 years in fresh bourbon barrels and bottled at a robust 50% ABV, this Single Malt Scotch Whisky presents both the gentleness of the Highlands and a surprisingly pronounced smoky tone. Non-chill filtered and bottled in its natural colour, it feels pure – and delightfully complex.	Right from the start, the aroma is bold: warm BBQ smoke, hints of smoked ham, and scorched wood dominate the nose. Beneath, a creamy vanilla softness adds depth. A subtle maritime breeze occasionally surfaces – a whisper of seaweed in coastal air. This whisky doesn’t fully reveal itself at once; it rewards a patient nose.	On the palate, Wolfburn Vibrant Stills is rich and full-bodied. Notes of dark plum compote meet clove spice in a creamy, well-rounded mouthfeel. The bourbon cask influence returns with warming vanilla. Hints of citrus and a light salinity give it structure and clarity. The smoke is present yet never overwhelming – well-integrated and character-defining. Everything here feels genuine.	In the finish, the smoky notes intensify: charred wood and burnt toast mingle with light honey. A slightly gritty texture appears, reminiscent of oak tannins. Bright fruit is almost absent; instead, a rustic, subtly bitter warmth lingers – satisfyingly long.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/wolfburn-vibrant-stills-bourbon-barrel-2015-2023-8-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:44 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:44 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/wolfburn-vibrant-stills-bourbon-barrel-2015-2023-8-year-old.png
Glenfarclas 2012/2024 The Trinity Vintage Series	Glenfarclas	46	53				Glenfarclas 2012/2024 The Trinity Vintage Series – ein süßer, fruchtiger Whisky aus Speyside mit Noten von Streuselkuchen, Aprikose und Heu	Vanilla custard, apple and a pinch of dried apricot join the crumble cake as if they were having a party in a malty orchard. There's also a hint of hay - yes, hay! Not exactly what you'd expect in a whisky, but hey, who needs conventions? This aroma is so inviting that you almost forget to drink the whisky.	The first sip is like a sugary-sweet kiss from the orchard. Apricot and hay dance on the tongue, while the soft oak snuggles up to your taste buds like a good friend. The texture is creamy and oily, as if the whisky had decided to bathe itself in rape honey. It's sweet, but not overpowering - like a compliment from someone who really means what they say.	The finish is medium to long and leaves you with a smile. The oak makes its presence felt once again, accompanied by a light spiciness and a hint of fruitiness. The honey remains until the end.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenfarclas-2012-2024-the-trinity-vintage-series-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenfarclas-2012-2024-the-trinity-vintage-series.png
Glenlossie 1997/2016 19 Year Old - Signatory Vintage	Glenlossie	46	59				A classic Speysider with 19 years of maturation, bottled by the independent bottler Signatory Vintage - this sounds like an exciting dram for fans of elegant, grain-driven whiskies. The Glenlossie 1997/2016, bottled at 46% vol., promises an honest, unadulterated look at the underrated Glenlossie distillery in Scotland's Speyside.	Right from the first whiff, this whisky shows its fruity, cereal side: ripe apples and pears dominate, accompanied by notes reminiscent of oatmeal and crunchy muesli. A typical ‘muesli whisky’ - charming, but without much show.	On the palate, there is a slight spiciness that quickly combines with peach and apple notes. A hint of astringency provides some depth, while malt and wood give the Glenlossie structure. No flavour fireworks, but solid and pleasant to drink.	The finish is rather short, but brings a good portion of oak. It finishes dry and wood-accentuated - clean, but not particularly complex.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenlossie-1997-2016-19-year-old-signatory-vintage	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:55 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:55 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenlossie-1997-2016-19-year-old-signatory-vintage.png
Bowmore 2013/2024 10 Year Old - Douglas Laing	Bowmore	58.4	109				Die Islay-Brennerei Bowmore steht für rauchige Eleganz, oft kombiniert mit maritimen Noten und einer feinen Süße. In unabhängiger Abfüllung von Douglas Laing exklusiv für deinwhisky.de kommt dieser 10-jährige Single Malt mit kräftigen 58,4 % ABV ins Glas – ein Versprechen für Intensität und Tiefe.	The first impression is unconventional: there is a hint of musty shoebox and sweaty feet - unusual, but not unpleasant. After a few moments, the bouquet opens up: damp moss, a fresh sea breeze and delicate chalk notes are reminiscent of a stormy coast. The vanilla in the background provides a gentle rounding off and combines the rough Islay terrain with a subtle sweetness.	On the tongue, the Bowmore shows its full strength. A strong ash note dominates at first, before an almost sugary sweetness asserts itself - surprising and fascinating at the same time. Fresh vanilla and pear play with the oily mouthfeel and contribute to the pleasant balance. The smoke always remains present, but without masking the other flavours.	Long, voluminous and warming. The oak note typical of many Islay whiskies is held back here, instead the impression of light-coloured fruit and sugar remains. Despite its strength, the finish is comparatively fresh and light.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/bowmore-2013-2024-10-year-old-douglas-laing	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:08 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:08 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/bowmore-2013-2024-10-year-old-douglas-laing.png
Benrinnes 12 Year Old - 82 Chapters to Newcastle	Benrinnes	57.2	85				How good is it?	When nosing, Benrinnes inevitably reminds us of strawberries and those cherry lollipops that every child has eaten. There is also a pleasant sweetness of dark fruit and an unmistakable hint of wine. Not surprising given the 12-month 1st fill port cask finish in a hogshead.	Significantly more oaky than in the nosing, this single malt at cask strength opens with a creamy flavour. A pleasant, subtle sweetness interweaves with a great fruity flavour. Again with a strong strawberry flavour, the Benrinnes impressively demonstrates what a finish in a good cask can achieve. We also find the wine flavours here again, as well as a note that does not remind us of real strawberries, but rather of those pseudo-strawberry flavours from children's sweets.	The finish of the Scotch whisky with the censored squirrel on the label is in fact the least exciting thing about the bottling and can be described in three words: Long, Spicy, Fruity.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/82-chapters-to-new-castle-benrinnes-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:27 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:27 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/82-chapters-to-new-castle-benrinnes-12.png
Wolfburn Love Potion	Wolfburn	46	75				How good is it?	On the nose, Wolfburn Love Potion reveals a tantalising composition of fragrances. An abundance of vanilla meets the sweet scent of grape sugar, reminiscent of a sumptuous gift basket full of fruit. These flavours invite you to linger and arouse curiosity about what is yet to come.	The flavour of this Scotch is just as rich as the aroma. A clear woody note characterises the first impression, followed by flavours of pear and quince. The sticky sweetness of the whisky is accompanied by a subtle maltiness that gives it depth. Despite its youthfulness, this single malt is pleasant to drink.	The finish of the Love Potion is medium-long and leaves a hint of tannins and spice on the tongue. Vanilla and white pepper round off the flavour experience and leave a warm, spicy aftertaste.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/wolfburn-love-potion-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:04 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:04 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/wolfburn-love-potion.png
Cardhu 18 Year Old	Cardhu	40	70				How good is it?	On the nose, the Speysider opens heavy but not intense. Distinct woody flavours cover the lighter notes of light fruits such as pears and the hint of honey with vanilla that resonates. Floral nuances and a hint of peach or apricot can be sensed.	The Cardhu 18 year old is unfortunately a little weak on the chest. Soft and spicy dry, it has notes of oak, peach, avocado and honeydew melon. The Speysider is infused with a slight sweetness and some baking cocoa. The flavour profile is pleasantly mild, but the nose clearly promised us more here.	The finish is nicely tart and spicy.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/cardhu-18-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:12 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:12 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/cardhu-18.png
Glen Elgin 12 Year Old	Glen Elgin	43	35				How good is it?	The Scotch opens with hazelnuts and almonds before a fruity sweetness spreads. Notes of toffee caramel and marzipan round off the composition.	Plum and toffee are the base notes we taste. Accents of malty sweetness, marzipan and spicy oak shape the overall picture.	The medium-long finish is very dry but still pleasant. Dark chocolate with a touch of oak.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-elgin-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:05 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:05 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-elgin-12.png
Glen Garioch 21 Year Old 2003/2024 - Wu DRAM Clan	Glen Garioch	53.9	340				Is the old school bottling worth it?	The very first nosing reveals a dramatically dense flavour that doesn't do things by halves. Dried plum and sultanas greet the nose - dark, rich, almost mystical. Behind this lies bittersweet dark chocolate, paired with a hint of old leather and woody honey. A subtle woody note with a nutty undertone provides depth without being overpowering. The cinnamon plays a subtle role - more suggestive than demanding.  This whisky doesn't just whiff - it speaks. It speaks of dark cask ageing, of patience, of craftsmanship and character.	On the palate, Glen Garioch explodes in an inimitable way. Spices dominate: Clove, cinnamon and a hint of black pepper, accompanied by tobacco notes and again the leather that the nose already hinted at. These are joined by blackberries, sultanas and dates, but with a restrained sweetness - never sticky, always balanced.  The texture is extremely full-bodied, almost creamy. The alcohol is present, but excellently integrated. Everything seems harmonious, intentional, composed - not by chance. A dram that invites you to chew, it is so multi-layered.	The finish is eternally long, dry, warming and pleasantly peppery. It leaves an impression of old oak, coffee grounds and spice - but not an aftertaste that tires. Rather a dignified finish, like the last sentence in a novel that you want to read again straight away.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-garioch-21-year-old-2003-2024-wu-dram-clan	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:45 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:45 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-garioch-21-year-old-2003-2024-wu-dram-clan.png
Lochlea Our Barley	Lochlea	46	50				How good is it?	Is this a honey wine? We have a massively sweet, fruity sweetness. Ripe pears, syrup and cream caramel. Very mild, spiciness is almost not noticeable at all. Maybe a little in the background.	Sweet and spicy and with a good portion of grain and honey, the Lochlea Our Barley makes its way into the mouth. Burnt toast and an alcoholic spiciness follow. There's a little vanilla and some cinnamon in the background. A quite interesting breakfast.	The spiciness settles on the palate. Dry and medium in length, a young, yet well-balanced single malt says goodbye with a little sweetness reminiscent of sunflower honey.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lochlea-our-barley-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:13 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:13 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lochlea-our-barley.png
Benromach 40 Year Old Batch 2 (2022)	Benromach	56.5	1999				Whiskies of this age are rare. Whiskies of this calibre are even rarer. The Benromach 40 Years Batch 2, bottled in 2022 at a bold 56.5% ABV, hails from Scotland's Speyside region and spent four decades in first fill sherry casks. This is not an everyday dram – it’s a sensorial time capsule, meticulously composed and highly limited.	What strikes first is a noble aged character – no dust, just maturity. Cognac-like notes rise gently, followed by ginger, maple syrup and a touch of honey. There’s an underlying richness of sweet aged leather, ripe tobacco, and a whiff of coffee grounds. Add to that deeply overripe red fruits, baked apple and sugar beet – it’s an aromatic tapestry that unfolds slowly and rewards patience.	On the palate, this whisky is surprisingly vivid. Despite its age, it’s oily, full-bodied and layered. The entry is sweet, with orange and grapefruit bringing a light tang. Then the cask takes over: curry, Indian spices, and dry tannic structure. Toward the end, ginger makes a comeback, followed by a flash of sour cherries, adding drama and contrast.	The finish is medium in length, but full of character. Notes of old oak, some bordering on burnt wood, dominate the aftertaste. Intense spice lingers, balanced by a subtle return of fruity undertones – the sherry cask’s final whisper.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/benromach-40-year-old-batch-2-2022-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:04 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:04 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/benromach-40-year-old-batch-2-2022.png
Glen Elgin 2008/2020 - Sansibar	Glen Elgin	58.7	159				How good is it?	To be honest: the nose gives hope. Nougat meets vanilla, plus an interesting herbal note with sage and a hint of herbal tea. There is also a hint of pear, which adds a certain freshness. Everything has been good so far - but unfortunately it doesn't stop there.	Sobering. Yes, there is vanilla. Yes, it's creamy. But then? Then... Nothing. Thin on the palate, as if someone had forgotten to fill it with flavours. A little light fruity sweetness, but overall? Boring.	The finish? Juicy, slightly vanilla-like, a hint of oak. Sounds nice, but doesn't linger. It's gone as quickly as it comes - as if it's in a hurry to shirk its responsibilities.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-elgin-2008-2020-sansibar-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:59 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:59 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-elgin-2008-2020-sansibar.png
Glenrothes 1988/2014 26 Year Old - Hart Brothers	Glenrothes	50.5	180				How good is it?	The nose is already very complex, with a wide range of aromas. We find vanilla, honey and a floral fruitiness similar to buttercup. These are joined by sweet notes of fresh peach and apple. When the malt is allowed to breathe a little, spicy notes of oak and malted barley emerge.	Like a typical Speysider, the profile evokes fruity freshness on the tongue. We think of peach iced tea, still vanilla sweetness and a malty cereal note on the tip of the tongue. This is overlaid by stronger flavours of oak, herbal tea and white pepper. There is also a very slight nuttiness, mostly reminiscent of almonds. This malt is not dry and is extremely oily.	The medium-long finish pushes a very pleasant, but quite discreet, amount of oak. No bitterness at all, just pure, natural, spicy oak.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenrothes-26-year-old-hart-brothers	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:41 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:41 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenrothes-26-jahre-hart-brothers.png
Lagavulin 11 Year Old Offerman Edition	Lagavulin	46	75				How good is it?	The 11-year-old bottling opens malty-sweet and with aromas of smoked paprika, cinnamon, pear and mint. Of course, we also find the typical Lagavulin charred oak wood.	Peaty-sweet and massively dry, the Lagavulin tastes less heavy than the nose would have us expect. We are encountered with a dryness that makes us think of baking cocoa and coffee powder. Characterised by cereal aromas, the Scotch is very soft and well balanced - perhaps too soft for a Lagavulin? We perceive the Guinness cask with roasted malt aromas. Unfortunately, only in nuances.	The finish is dry and long with a fair amount of peat smoke, as we would expect from a Lagavulin.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lagavulin-11-year-old-offerman	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:07 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:07 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lagavulin-11-offerman.png
Wolfburn Langskip	Wolfburn	58	42				A sweet cask strength Scotch from the Highlands with tropical fruit, vanilla & maritime freshness.	The first impression: surprisingly smooth for the cask strength. An aroma unfolds that combines maritime freshness with dessert notes. The salty breeze of a coastal whisky meets crème brûlée, salted caramel and apple crumble. Vanilla custard dances in the background with a light malt note and a hint of honey - a real dessert for the nose. No alcoholic sting despite the strength - just multi-layered, balanced flavours.	The flavour of the Wolfburn Langskip is like an unadorned summer whisky at cask strength: creamy, dry, honest and very sweet. The first impression is of hay, almonds and a clear cereal note. Then banana, papaya and pineapple come to the fore - tropical fruits in the cask strength version. The texture is thick, almost oily, with a real tang. White pepper adds the necessary spice to the sweet profile.	The finish is pleasantly warming, sweet and medium-long - without becoming bitter. Light oak notes provide structure without dominating. The finish is reminiscent of melted sugar with a hint of malt - pleasantly round and accessible.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/wolfburn-langskip-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:42 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:42 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/wolfburn-langskip.png
Benromach 10 Year Old	Benromach	43	39				How good is it?	After the nose has become accustomed to the smoke, we begin to perceive sweet aromas like sherry. After a while in the glass, light vanilla and caramel and a hint of toffee become noticeable.	At first, we have the feeling of an overripe, mouth-filling cherry in the mouth. Afterwards, the sweetness changes from a kind of white chocolate to a harsher dark chocolate. The smoke is almost no longer present, instead it subliminally accompanies the slightly leathery and dry feeling on the tongue.	Also in the medium-long finish the smoke is rather subliminal and flavours like honey, vanilla and toffee are dominant.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/benromach-10-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/benromach-10.png
North British 1991 31 Year Old - Hogshead Imports	North British	46.7	99				The North British 1991, a 31-year-old single grain whisky from the famous Lowland region of Scotland, is a highlight for lovers of matured whiskies. Bottled by the independent bottler Hogshead Imports at 46.7% vol., this whisky presents an exciting journey through intense aromas and layers of flavour. But does it live up to the promise of its impressive age?	From the very first nosing, it becomes clear that this whisky has a story to tell. Caramel, as intense as melted sugar on the hob, meets velvety vanilla and sweet honey. A subtle note of soft oak resonates, accompanied by a hint of stone fruit that lends a fruity depth. Surprising and slightly unorthodox is a note reminiscent of thinner or touch-up pencil - an exciting contrast.	A mixture of fresh wood and damp sawdust unfolds on the palate, providing a rustic touch. The sweetness comes to the fore in the form of cream caramels, giving the whisky a soft and almost creamy texture. Despite the complexity, the flavour is not overloaded, but balanced, with a slightly sweet base note reminiscent of patisserie.	In the finish, the North British is surprisingly restrained. A slight warmth spreads, but disappears relatively quickly.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/north-british-1991-31-year-old-hogshead-imports	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:15 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:15 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/north-british-1991-31-year-old-hogshead-imports.png

Caperdonich 2024 27 Year Old The Tasteful 8 - Brühler Whiskyhaus	Caperdonich	52.1	399				The Caperdonich Distillery is one of the vanished legends of the Scotch whisky world. Closed in 2002 and finally demolished in 2011, its bottlings are now coveted rarities.	The first impression is soft and harmonious. Notes of honey and vanilla dominate and give the whisky a pleasant sweetness. These are joined by toffee nuances reminiscent of butter caramel and a clear malty depth that emphasises the long maturation. A subtle nutty note resonates and lends structure, but tends to remain in the background. The alcohol is well integrated and does not push itself to the fore.	The palate reveals a pleasant balance between sweetness and spice. Caramel and Christmas spices open up the flavours, accompanied by a tangy liveliness that is almost unexpected for a 27-year-old. A slightly perfumed note shimmers through - a hint of floral elegance without being overpowering. The texture is medium dense, smooth, but not exceptionally oily.	The finish is intense and spicy, with herbal and spicy notes gaining the upper hand. A clear oak presence ensures a dry but not overloaded finish. The flavours linger for a long time, but lack the final kick that characterises a truly exceptional whisky.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/caperdonich-2024-27-year-old-the-tasteful-8-bruehler-whiskyhaus-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:56 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:56 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/caperdonich-2024-27-year-old-the-tasteful-8-bruehler-whiskyhaus.png
Ledaig 17 Year Old 2006/2024 -  Gordon & MacPhail	Tobermory	56.5	160				Not for the faint-hearted, but fascinatingly complex. Who dares?	The personality of this Ledaig is revealed from the very first nosing. A real sherry bomb explodes in the glass, but behind it lurks something unexpected: a clear sulphur note that immediately reminds you of old match heads. This is joined by overripe plums that are past their prime, followed by flavours reminiscent of old leather and a damp compost heap. That sounds off-putting at first, and to be honest, it is. This whisky smells 'dirty' and 'mouldy' - terms that do not normally have positive connotations. But this is precisely where the fascination lies: between all these earthy, almost disgusting notes, there are flashes of fresh strawberries and a very subtle smoke nestles against the composition like a campfire character.	The polarising profile continues on the palate. Sour cherries dominate the attack, accompanied by a mineral, earthy base note reminiscent of wet earth after a downpour. The sulphur is also present here, albeit more discreetly than on the nose. An interesting sweet and sour dynamic develops, supported by citrus notes reminiscent of pink grapefruit. The driftwood note that spreads across the mid-palate is particularly fascinating. It lends the whisky a maritime depth that perfectly matches its origin from the Isle of Mull.	The finish surprises with its length and unexpected sweetness. This is where 17 years of ageing shows its best side: mocha flavours merge with strong oak notes, while the smoke only resonates subtly in the background. Age has taken the edge off what was probably originally a smokier character and moulded it into a complex, warm finish.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ledaig-17-year-old-2006-2024-gordon-macphail	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:28 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:28 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ledaig-17-year-old-2006-2024-gordon-macphail.png
Dailuaine 2012/2022 #308764 - Signatory Vintage	Dailuaine	59.2	53				How good is it?	The first flavours are reminiscent of malt sweets and cream caramel, followed by sweet blossom honey. Exotic fruit notes such as plantain and papaya add an extra dimension, which is rounded off by a light vanilla sugar note. Despite this tantalising sweetness, the whisky is already slightly demanding and unpleasant on the nose.	On the palate, the Dailuaine develops a sugary sweetness accompanied by an oily texture. The flavours wet the mouth and continue to develop intensively. However, the distinct ethanol sharpness makes the flavour somewhat rough. Fresh wood and creamy caramel again characterise the taste, while an unripe mango provides a fresh but unripe contrast.	The finish is surprisingly short. It remains juicy and is dominated by fresh oak, which is accompanied by a pleasant vanilla note. However, the brilliance that one might expect from a single cask in this category is also absent here.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/dailuaine-2012-signatory-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:46 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:46 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/dailuaine-9-signatory-vintage-308764.png
Port Ellen 1982 - Malts of Scotland	Port Ellen	58.1	1299				Can it impress in tasting?	We are sitting in a small old wooden hut by the sea on an old leather sofa with a view of the Port Ellen distillery on the island of Islay in Scotland. In front of us is a buffet of dried dates wrapped in bacon, figs, sea asparagus and some good German wholemeal bread, which smells wonderful. It is accompanied by salted caramel and chocolate-coated coffee beans. A gentle sea breeze blows through the open window and light smoke from the campfire with paprika, stick bread and smoked bacon.	We reach for the bowl with a varied mix of red berries, which are fruity, sweet and quite creamy. A few berries taste a little strange. They are the redcurrants - they must have been lying in ashes from an old barbecue. A mill with white pepper and a salt mill are on the table, probably for the peppers on the skewers by the campfire. The mills certainly won't be for our mint and herb tea. Now we are served the smoked bacon - it goes surprisingly well with mint tea. It starts to rain outside.	The campfire extinguishes. Woody and ashy flavours linger for a long time, slightly musty from the rain and yet dusty and dry.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/port-ellen-1982-malts-of-scotland-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:21 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:21 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/port-ellen-0002-malts-of-scotland.png
Kingsbarns Balcomie	Kingsbarns	46	43				Scotland and golf – a classic combination. The Kingsbarns Balcomie is named after a golf course in Fife and comes from the Lowland distillery of the same name. The Wemyss family, already known as an independent bottler, has been operating Kingsbarns since 2014. For this whisky, Isabella Wemyss relies on maturation in Oloroso sherry casks made of American white oak. The result? A smooth, sweet dram that carries the signature of this young distillery.	Right from the first sniff, Balcomie reveals its fresh character. Vanilla rises to the nose, followed by crisp apples and pears. A hint of Federweißer adds a certain liveliness. Subtle notes of milk chocolate and a grainy base aroma reminiscent of freshly malted barley round out the profile.	On the palate, the whisky is malty and fruity-fresh. Notes of fruit bread and coconut lend it a sweet, slightly exotic component. The spice remains pleasantly restrained: white pepper, gentle oak spice, and a hint of cinnamon provide balance. Despite its youth, the Balcomie remains smooth and well-rounded.	The finish is spicy and warming. Clove and hazelnut leave a pleasant impression. A slight youthful character shines through, but the overall picture remains harmonious.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/kingsbarns-balcomie-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/kingsbarns-balcomie.png
Ardbeg Ardcore Committee Release	Ardbeg	50.1	130				How good is it?	At first, the smell reminds us more of a Laphroaig than an Ardbeg. We identify phenolic smoke that fades into a steam note. It reminds us of neatly burnt toast. Fighting through the smoke, an Ardbeg-typical vanilla-citrus note emerges. This is accompanied by roasted malt and ham.	The typical Ardbeg anise with a certain seawater saltiness hovers over a not-so-intense campfire ember flavour. Gradually, vanilla and chocolate fight their way to the fore. We would have expected more chocolateiness from the dark roasted barley malt. Roasted aromas are present, but rather subtle. Overall, not much, we have to say, unfortunately.	The spicy-dry finish is medium long, but that's not what we've come to expect from Ardbeg. Not very impressive.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ardbeg-ardcore-committee-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:15 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:15 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ardbeg-ardcore-committee.png
Talisker 18 Year Old	Talisker	45.8	160				How good is it?	Smoky like vanilla cigarillos, later greeted by slightly mossy oak. Exceptionally balanced and pleasant on the nose. Small salty accents evoke memories of the Baltic Sea beach in the rain. On the fruity side, we find oranges and peaches refined with a hint of marzipan.	The almost two-decade-old whisky is soft and flattering, with a minimal and subtle smoke that is reminiscent of charcoal in a fire basket. The oranges and peach from the nose are present in the mid-palate with a little rock sugar and subtle sea salt. Interesting chalky notes as well as some earthy aromas and vanilla round off the flavour.	Sweet and salty, we feel the Talisker on the palate for a long time. Light tannins follow, but sweet vanilla remains at the front of the tongue. The Talisker chilli catch is of course also noticeable, but not as prominent as in other bottlings.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/talisker-18-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:24 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:24 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/talisker-18.png
Tormore 10 Year Old Blueprint Bourbon Barrel	Tormore	48	80				Fruity, oily, surprisingly complex – an honest everyday dram without any pretensions.	The nose greets us with a veritable fruit basket – juicy pear, crisp apples and velvety peaches dance around the nose. The fresh fruit is accompanied by a lemony liveliness that gives the whole a lovely sparkle. Then, surprisingly, a hint of menthol is added – not pungent, but cool and fresh, like a breath of mint on a summer's day.  In the background, there is a subtle hint of peat, but it remains discreetly in the background. The bourbon cask maturation is noticeable in a slight grainy note, which lends an American nuance to the fruity Speyside character.	The first sip reveals a wonderfully oily texture – that's the 48% alcohol content making itself felt. The fruity aroma continues on the palate: apple and pear are the main players, supported by exotic pineapple and a lovely hint of honey.  The lemon remains present and provides freshness, while a subtle melon sweetness joins in. Malty tones come through from the bourbon cask without being overpowering. The promised smoke? Barely noticeable.	The finish surprises with a pleasant chilli heat that develops slowly. Oak is noticeable – not too dominant, but present enough to show that American wood was used here. Honey accompanies the finish and provides a pleasant sweetness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tormore-10-year-old-blueprint-bourbon-barrel-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:19 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:19 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tormore-10-year-old-blueprint-bourbon-barrel.png
Ruadh Maor 12 Year Old - Drám Mór	Glenturret	56.4	115				How good is it?	The aroma reminds us of a burning, rusty fire barrel. We perceive the smoke of smoldering fire without finding earthier notes of peat or tar. The smoke has a hint of iodine, but by no means as plaster-like as one would expect from Islay malts. After a few minutes in the glass, the First Fill Bourbon cask can unfold its effect. We detect sweet vanilla and a hint of honey.	Upon first sip, we immediately taste the sweetness of glazed honey bacon. An almost barbecue-like combination of sweet vanilla and meaty smoke unfolds on the palate. The notion of iodine, present in the aroma, has completely disappeared. The mouthfeel is very pleasant. The malt has high viscosity, is slightly dry, and has a tingling dusty quality.	The finish is simple and rather short for a smoky whisky. The delicate smoky profile lingers somewhat. Otherwise, we perceive fine oak notes and some sweet-spicy grill aromas.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ruadh-maor-12-dram-mor-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:14 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:14 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ruadh-maor-12-dram-mor.png
Lochlea 5 Year Old 2018/2023	Lochlea	50	100				How good is it?	And it is precisely this promised versatility that we perceive on the nose. First of all, an aroma that inevitably reminds us of roasted almonds and brown sugar. Then we smell rich and full-bodied Hawaiian pizza with a hint of colourful pepper. Exciting!	Very pleasantly oily and with some subtle oak, we are embraced by an orangy-lemony acidity - not too much and very tasty. The barrel combination also delivers, of course. Dates, overripe pears, cranberries and a good slice of sugar cake with a little caramel sauce.	In the medium to long finish, we are again presented with colourful pepper, slightly leathery notes and red fruits.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lochlea-5-year-old-2018-2023	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:23 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:23 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lochlea-5-2018-2023.png
Glenrothes 2013/2024 - Malts of Scotland	Glenrothes	57	79				How good is it?	The first impression on nosing is immediately reminiscent of a winter fruit market. Cinnamon-plum jam dominates the flavour, followed by the sweet depth of cherry jam and the aroma of wild strawberries and blackberries. These are joined by subtle notes of nutty chocolate and a pleasant spiciness reminiscent of tobacco. You immediately feel like you're in a cosy corner of the sofa next to the Christmas tree.	The Glenrothes unfolds its full power on the tongue. Spicy and warming is the best description here, and again it is the plums and cherries that dominate the flavour. A dark, sweet fruitiness reminiscent of nut chocolate and blackberries is complemented by the earthy flavour of roasted walnuts and tobacco. The flavours of old wood and dried fruit resonate in the background - this combination gives the whisky depth and impressive complexity without being too overpowering.	The finish is of medium length and brings the plum back to life. The spicy finish goes perfectly with the Christmas notes and makes you want to take the next sip. A pleasant tingling sensation remains on the palate, which prolongs the enjoyment a little longer.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenrothes-2013-2024-malts-of-scotland-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:41 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:41 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenrothes-2013-2024-malts-of-scotland.png
Auchroisk 2010/2023 12 Year Old - Sansibar	Auchroisk	60.8	99				How good is it?	The flavour of this whisky initially offers a pleasant sweetness with hints of ripe fruit and vanilla. This light, tantalising note is complemented by creamy milk chocolate, which promises a good start. However, less typical elements then come into play: a slightly grassy hay note and a hint of yoghurt add interesting facets, but are not entirely harmonious.  Another point that polarises: a subtle spiciness reminiscent of paprika. Whether this is perceived as positive or irritating is probably in the eye (or rather the nose) of the beholder.	The first sip immediately reveals the high alcohol content. The whisky is strong, almost sharp, and the flavours initially struggle to develop. Vanilla and a certain fruitiness are noticeable, but they do not really manage to balance out the intensity of the alcohol.  A dry impression, accompanied by a hint of chocolate, provides a certain depth. Nevertheless, the overall picture remains rather unbalanced - the individual components seem to stand next to each other instead of harmonising with each other.	The finish of the Auchroisk is characterised by distinct oak, which is strong and slightly bitter. There is a delicate fruity note reminiscent of redcurrants, but it remains in the background and is not very pronounced. Milk chocolate is also present here, albeit rather discreetly.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/auchroisk-2010-2023-sansibar-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:19 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:19 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/auchroisk-2010-2023-sansibar.png
Loch Lomond 18 Year Old	Loch Lomond	46	66				How good is it?	On the nose, this single malt presents an intriguing combination of roasted aromas and exotic fruitiness. We detect caramel and toasted pine nuts, accompanied by hints of grapefruit and a grainy banana bread. The fruity sweetness is enveloped in a light but cool smoke, reminiscent of egg carton (which may sound negative, but is not meant as such).	On the palate, Loch Lomond 18 begins with a fruity sweetness. The mouthfeel is soft and oily, spreading astringently and presenting a full-bodied berry note with hints of plums and oranges. Additionally, there are exotic citrus-like flavors. After a short while, the aroma shifts to herbal mint notes and surprisingly clear phenolic almost rubber-like smoke.	The finish is medium-length and warming, leaving an enduring impression of spicy oak and a hint of white pepper, without being sharp. Tobacco and tea leaves round off the experience.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/loch-lomond-18-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:19 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:19 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/loch-lomond-18.png
Ballindalloch 2016/2024 8 Year Old	Ballindalloch	60.8	119				Ballindalloch Distillery, one of the younger distilleries in Scotland's famous Speyside region, has created a whisky that combines both strength and elegance with its Ballindalloch 2016/2024 8 Year Old.	The first sniff reveals a floral splendour reminiscent of rose water and gardens in bloom. Underneath, notes of green apple and a fine, perfumed elegance resonate. Despite the high alcohol content, the ethanol scent is only subtly perceptible and only lends the whisky a subtle spiciness. Over time, vanilla and oaky nuances are added to round off the flavour.	The first sip surprises with a waxy texture and a tangy freshness that invigorates the palate. The flavour is dominated by malty and cereal notes that shape the character of the whisky. A pinch of parsley gives it an unexpected but pleasant spiciness, while vanilla and a certain clarity of flavour provide balance. This whisky puts the grain centre stage.	The finish is short, but by no means insignificant. A warming sensation spreads, accompanied by the subtle bitterness of the oak. This slight astringency contrasts nicely with the initial sweetness and leaves a clean, inviting aftertaste.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ballindalloch-2016-2024-8-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ballindalloch-2016-2024-8-year-old.png
Lochlea Fallow Edition (First Crop)	Lochlea	46	60				How good is it?	Crystal clear: Ripe dark fruits, leather, dark chocolate. We expected this and got it. Pleasantly, raspberries, strawberries and cinnamon still resonate. Somewhere, after some time in the glass, we find a few wine aromas and some burnt wood. Beautifully defined profile with exciting secondary aromas.	Fresh and at the same time heavy-oily, the Fallow Edition lays in the mouth. As in the nose, we have a red berry mix, some tannins and oak spice. Not as dry as we would have expected, the Lowland single malt qualifies as an excellent sherry bomb.	In the warming, medium-long finish, we find the dark chocolate from the nose again.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lochlea-fallow-edition-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:57 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:57 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lochlea-fallow-edition-2022.png
Lochlea Cask Strength Batch 1	Lochlea	60.1	62				How good is it?	The single malt opens immediately with ripe light and dark fruits - there is no need to 'let it breathe'. Pear, apple, blood orange, rum, cinnamon, tobacco leaves, milk chocolate, vanilla and coffee beans open a true composition of flavours. Red grapes are also perceptible, which flatter with a light wine note.	Full steam ahead - the usual Lochlea signature is clearly in the foreground. Bright fruits and light nutty notes. Mouth-watering and slightly dry, the whisky shines with caramel, vanilla and forest honey. Surprisingly not spicy at all and really smooth, we taste a big load of buttery cinnamon buns. The palate is rounded off by toasted croutons.	Medium-long, the cask-strength whisky tingles on the palate with hints of fresh oak and chocolate.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lochlea-cask-strength-batch-1-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:42 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:42 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lochlea-cask-strength-batch-1.png

Ballechin 2004/2023 19 Year Old	Edradour	55	198				Discover the Ballechin 2004/2023 19 year old - a smoky masterpiece from the Highlands with intense BBQ, bacon and tar flavours. Perfect for fans of powerful whiskies!	Ballechin reveals its smoky soul from the very first sniff. Black BBQ and an extremely bacon-y character are dominant, immediately evoking associations with smoked meat. Underneath, notes of tar, lime and even a hint of burnt rubber resonate. It's like entering an old factory - industrial, raw and yet fascinating.	On the tongue, the Scotch unfolds with a warming, full load of vapour. The flavour is intense and complex: old machine oil, warm rubber tyres and even a hint of linoleum make this whisky a real experience. The smokiness dominates, but it is accompanied by a subtle fruitiness that provides a surprise.	The finish is long and voluminous, with a spicy note that lingers for a long time. The subtle oak is noticeable, but is overlaid by the intense smokiness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ballechin-2004-2023-19-year-old-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:14 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:14 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ballechin-2004-2023-19-year-old.png
Glenlivet Nadurra 2015	Glenlivet	59.8	70				The Glenlivet distillery is one of the best-known names in the Speyside region of Scotland and delivers a strong single malt whisky with the Nadurra 2015, which does not require an age statement. With an impressive 59.8 % vol., this whisky is aimed at connoisseurs who are not afraid of intense flavours and a high alcohol content. But what is really behind the high strength? Is it worth buying?	On first nosing, the Glenlivet Nadurra unfolds a fascinating spectrum: floral notes mingle with the warm scent of honey and shortbread, reminiscent of a classic afternoon tea. A slight hint of spicy oak and candy floss joins in, with the latter offering almost bourbon-like echoes. A promising start that prepares the senses for a sweet but not overloaded whisky.	The Nadurra shows its strength from the very first sip. White sugar and coconut notes dominate at first, before a light spiciness and the fruity character of white peach assert themselves. This is accompanied by a creamy cream caramel note and an oily, viscous texture that makes the whisky very present. The white pepper in the finish reinforces the spiciness and provides a warming finish.	The finish of the Glenlivet Nadurra is surprisingly short to medium in length. Fresh oak notes dominate, accompanied by a hint of honey and minimal light fruity flavours. Although pleasant, it lacks the depth that many connoisseurs might expect from such a strong whisky.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenlivet-nadurra-2015-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:15 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:15 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenlivet-nadurra-2015.png
Strathisla 24 Year Old 1992/2016 - Malts of Scotland	Strathisla	56.2	199				The Strathisla 1992/2016 from Malts of Scotland is a "sturdy dog" that acts like a good evening herbal tea – calming and exciting at the same time. World class from Speyside.	The composition begins waxy, almost like the interior of an old library, where leather and beeswax seal the shelves. Then a floral bouquet opens up, which seems surprisingly feminine for a self-proclaimed 'sturdy male' – as if he were wearing a heart of wildflowers under his lumberjack shirt. The fragrance is not intrusive, not like an overzealous perfumery department, but subtle and sophisticated, like the discreet scent of a well-groomed gentleman of the old school. Forest honey covers it like a golden veil – not the industrially clarified supermarket honey, but that dark, resinous forest honey with personality and history. Vanilla joins in, but not as a soloist, rather as a member of an ensemble that knows when to step back. And then, the wood. Lots of wood. But not that young, aggressive oak that screams 'I'm here!', but the dignified wood of old furniture, polished by decades. Apricot and pear dance on the edge, dried fruits that have exchanged their sweetness for velvety depth. And – oh yes – green tobacco. Not the smoky cigarette, but the fresh leaves in the drying barn, earthy and aromatic.	We noted it as 'sparkling' – that electrifying tingle on the tongue that signifies life. Spicy, yes, but not one-dimensionally spicy. It's as if someone had knocked over a Michelin-starred chef's spice cabinet and then decided that the chaos was perfect. Full-bodied and oily, this whisky envelops the mouth like a well-fitting winter coat – protection and luxury at the same time. 'Has power' is an understatement. It doesn't just have power, it IS power. But this power is never crude. The oak, oh that wonderful oak, presents itself in its most mature form – not bitter, not tannic, but wise and balanced. The complexity is what elevates this palate from good to extraordinary. While you are still trying to decipher the spice, the next wave of flavours has already built up. Fruit mingles with wood, sweetness with tartness, creaminess with precision. It's like reading a good novel – each page reveals new nuances without losing the thread.	He stays, takes a book from your shelf, sits down in your best armchair and makes himself comfortable. The soft oak – and here its true age shows – dominates, but with the gentleness of an old sage who imparts his lessons without raising his voice. A hint of iodine creeps in, unexpected for a Speysider, but welcome – a maritime whisper amidst the landlocked elegance. Garden herbs, perhaps thyme, perhaps sage, round off the finish, as if someone had wandered through a herb garden on the way out. The finish is not spectacular in the sense of fireworks and fanfare, but spectacular in its consistency and depth.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/strathisla-24-year-old-1992-2016-malts-of-scotland	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:14 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:14 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/strathisla-24-year-old-1992-2016-malts-of-scotland.png
Dalmore Valour	Dalmore	40	45				How good is it?	Fresh strong citrus note, sweet port, oranges and a little honey. A little cinnamon or cardamom and dust join in.	Lots of chocolate, exaggerated oaky bitterness and poorly integrated alcohol. Plus earth, light plum and even more bitterness. Little flavour and a lot of water. Harmony? Not at all.	Short without exciting notes. Bitter.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/dalmore-valour-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:46 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:46 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/dalmore-valour.png
Braeval 1994/2019 - Sansibar	Braeval	44.5	284				The Speyside-Prototype	A gentle, inviting sweetness from the glass. Honey and vanilla dominate the first impression, accompanied by creamy caramel that suggests an almost buttery creaminess. But this whisky has more than just sweetness: a malty depth provides structure, while oak notes are subtle.  After a few minutes in the glass, the flavour opens up further - and suddenly a light coconut note is added. Very exciting! An underlying floral freshness gives the whisky a fine elegance. No alcoholic burn, no intrusive notes - simply a wonderfully balanced nose.	The first impression on the palate confirms what the nose promised: creamy, round, sweet and at the same time full of character. The vanilla and honey are immediately present and envelop the palate with a silky texture. The malt then becomes more prominent, and with it a pleasant spiciness that testifies to the long maturation in oak barrels.  However, the highlight is the subtle coconut note that slowly blends into the flavour - almost as if the whisky has been given a hint of tropical exoticism. The oak remains present, but never dominant. There is no excessive bitterness or dryness, but a perfect balance between sweetness, spice and wood.	The finish is exactly what you would expect from a 25-year-old Speyside malt: pleasantly long, warm and deep. A slight peppery note provides a spicy kick without being overpowering. The oak notes come to the fore, but they are mild and pleasant. At the very end, a fine blend of sweet and spicy flavours lingers on the tongue.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/braeval-1994-2019-sansibar-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:39 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:39 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/braeval-1994-2019-sansibar.png
Macallan 12 Year Old Double Cask	Macallan	40	72				How good is it?	The first impression is characterized by tangy red fruits and sweet honey. Light hay notes, vanilla, and mild oak follow. A hint of baking powder, cinnamon, and candle wax rounds off the aromatic profile, adding a subtle spiciness.	Smooth and creamy, the Macallan 12 Double Cask unfolds on the palate. Honey sweetness dominates at first, followed by grassy tones, plum, and a pinch of white pepper. Cinnamon adds a warming spice that complements the overall impression harmoniously.	The finish is rather short, with light oak spice and gentle dryness. A subtle wood note appears but fades quickly.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/macallan-12-double-cask-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:18 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:18 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/macallan-12-double-cask.png
Port Charlotte 2004/2023 18 Year Old	Bruichladdich	54.3	200				Sometimes you come across a whisky that immediately captivates you - and sometimes you come across a bottling that makes you wonder. The Port Charlotte 2004/2023, an 18-year-old Islay representative from the renowned Bruichladdich Distillery, is just such a case.	The first whiff is a mixture of the familiar and the irritating. The warm smoke of a campfire rises up, accompanied by a slightly nutty, almost fermented note - walnuts that have lain a little too long? Caramel and malt provide a sweet base, while cereal flavours are reminiscent of freshly ground grain. Then red fruits suddenly appear - not dominant, but as a subtle nuance in the background.	The first sip - and there it is, the smoke. Voluminous, powerful and yet elegant, not too aggressive, but perfectly interwoven with the structure. Then comes the flavour: intense oak tones that combine with woody berries and a hint of fried bacon. A hint of salt comes through, perhaps a reminiscence of the stormy Islay coast? The cask maturation is clearly evident, but without overwhelming the distillate - with the oak notes clearly gaining the upper hand.	Long and intense - not a gentle finish, but a real finale. The bitter oak remains dominant, but is offset by a subtle berry note. And then an almost BBQ-like ham note emerges, which combines with the smoke and ensures a savoury, slightly salty finish.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/port-charlotte-2004-2023-18-year-old-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:53 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:53 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/port-charlotte-2004-2023-18-year-old.png
Teaninich 11 Year Old Malaga Cask Finish - James Eadie	Teaninich	48.3	43				How good is it?	A potpourri of fruit flavours unfolds from the very first nosing: mango, grapefruit and peach characterise the opening and give the whisky a pleasant tropical freshness. These notes are accompanied by a hint of caramel and a nutty flavour of almond and marzipan. The light hints of milk chocolate are particularly charming, adding a subtle sweetness. An inviting start that is uncomplicated and harmonious.	On the palate, the Teaninich develops a pleasant freshness, carried by green grapes and red fruits, which give it a lively, fruity flavour. The whisky is wonderfully full-bodied and has a warming presence. The base is reminiscent of fresh cereals - perhaps even a slightly sweet Bircher muesli - with a slightly straw-like and toasted undertone. This combination gives the whisky structure and depth without making it too heavy.	The finish is long and balanced, with an unexpected hint of cheese curd that gives the whisky a creamy and slightly sweet component. Light tannins add a touch of dryness, while wet coffee powder and herbal tea add a spicy finish. A successful finish that is not too intrusive and makes you want to take the next sip.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/teaninich-11-year-old-malaga-cask-finish-james-eadie	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:23 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:23 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/teaninich-11-malaga-cask-finish-james-eadie.png
The Balvenie 12 Year Old Doublewood	Balvenie	40	50				How good is it?	The 12 year old Whisky opens with the sweetness of fresh blossom honey. The malt smells extremely juicy with malty vanilla notes. Behind the delicate sweetness, the bouquet is coated by a pleasant spicy sherry note.	Fittingly, it presents buttery soft and mild on the tongue. We perceive nutty notes and a hint of cinnamon. Likewise, an association of freshly caramelized crème brûlée imposes itself. Here, too, the sweet fresh aromas of sherry and the spiciness of European oak wrap the flavour.	The finish of the single malt is medium in length. As before, a wonderful marriage of fresh sweet flavors with spicy oak tones.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/balvenie-doublewood-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:01 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:01 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/balvenie-doublewood-12.png
Glen Scotia 2024 14 Year Old Icons of Campbeltown - Release No. 2: The Dragon	Glen Scotia	56.8	122				Is this beast tamed or an impetuous dragon fire?	A mixture of strong oak and an unexpected note of boiled egg - not unpleasant, but unusual. Behind this, a nutty depth unfolds with pistachios and pecan, accompanied by an underlying dark fruitiness. Plums and a hint of lime provide an exciting balance, while white pepper adds a spicy sharpness. A fragrance that unfolds and reveals new facets with every sniff.	Bone-dry and astringent - as if you had taken a sip from an old oak barrel. The maritime flavour is unmistakable, with salty notes mingling with the short, pithy oak. Despite the strength, the alcohol is very well integrated, giving the whisky structure. The mouthfeel is intense and sophisticated - a whisky that is uncompromising and certainly not immediately appealing to everyone.	Chilli heat meets the subtle sweetness of brown sugar. But that's not all - a pebbly, stony note remains, almost as if you were breathing over a salty sea cliff.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-scotia-2024-14-year-old-icons-of-campbeltown-release-no-2-the-dragon-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:10 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:10 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-scotia-2024-14-year-old-icons-of-campbeltown-release-no-2-the-dragon.png
Deanston 12 Year Old	Deanston	46.3	36				Attention, insider tip!	The Deanston 12 is a fresh, lively Highlander. Vanilla and honey are immediately present and bring a lovely sweetness. These are joined by cereal notes and the scent of green apple, which makes the whole thing fruity and light. The hint of freshly cut wood, reminiscent of a carpenter's workshop, is particularly exciting. And if you sniff closely, you will discover a subtle nuttiness that pleasantly rounds off the whisky.	Soft, but present. Walnuts and distinctive oak provide a pleasant spiciness, while honey and vanilla literally spread out in the mouth - and do so for a long time. There is also a floral, slightly grassy note reminiscent of a summer meadow. The citrus-like acidity, which is somewhere between grapefruit and lemon zest, is particularly exciting. This provides a lovely freshness without the whisky becoming too sour.	The finish is medium to long and has a spicy, fruity sweetness. Particularly striking: the fine black tea flavour, which provides a pleasantly dry finish. Not a big hit, but a nice, well-rounded thing.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/deanston-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:12 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:12 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/deanston-12-year-old.png
Deanston 11 Year Old 2009/2021 - Cask 116 - Brave New Spirits	Deanston	54.8	85				How good is it?	The Deanston offers some really exciting flavours in the nosing. The variety of flavours reminds us of nut corners with icing, sour cherry jam and fresh red grapes. There is also a slight vinegar note, which is not unpleasant, but rather provides a little freshness.	We also encounter nut corners again in the flavour. The entire range of fairground sweets can also be found. Everything from roasted almonds and candied strawberries to mulled wine sweets can be enjoyed. Some candy floss rounds off the oily appearance of the single malt.	Spicy, intense and warming, the cask strength Deanston has a medium finish with a slight chilli tingle in the back of the throat.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/deanston-11-year-old-brave-new-spirits-rebels-merlot-wine-barrique	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:24 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:24 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/deanston-11-brave-new-spirits.png
Octomore 2024 13 Year Old The Tasteful 8 - Brühler Whiskyhaus	Bruichladdich	58.1	260				Octomore - the name is legendary. A synonym for peaty-smoky excesses and at the same time proof that smoke is not just smoke. Year after year, fans wait for new bottlings, experiments with cask maturation, ageing and intense phenol power.	This whisky takes no prisoners. A clear cereal note mixes with a strong ash flavour reminiscent of a campfire that has gone out. Phenolic, yes - but not overwhelming. Instead, there is a certain maturity, a depth that you don't find in every Octomore. No cutting iodine hit, but a dark, almost oily smokiness.	One sip and the journey begins: clear, direct and intensely smoky. Anyone who knows Octomore knows that the smoke is not hidden here - it takes centre stage. However, it is not just smoke, but also a surprising sweetness that accompanies the start. This note is almost syrupy on the tongue before being replaced by a slightly citrusy freshness. However, the real highlight is the mouthfeel: clearly astringent - as if the whisky is drawing all moisture out of the mouth and leaving its mark. The high alcohol strength is evident here, but it remains well integrated.	The finish is, as expected, long and intense. Once again, a wave of smoke rolls over the tongue, this time with a fine, slightly peppery spiciness reminiscent of white pepper. The finish is dry but warm.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/octomore-2024-13-year-old-the-tasteful-8-bruehler-whiskyhaus	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:58 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:58 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/octomore-2024-13-year-old-the-tasteful-8-bruehler-whiskyhaus.png
Clynelish 14 Year Old	Clynelish	46	48				How good is it?	'I smell spring and there's a horse stable in there' was Marcel's first statement. And indeed. We perceive strong hay-like and flowery smells.  Definitely a floral environment. There is also a bit of sugar.	It tastes quite different from what it smells like. The path perceived in the nose through the flower meadow led directly to the beach. Oily-soft but still light, we taste sea salt, think of shells by the sea. Light citrus fruits can be found in the sand dune. Impressive and unexpected.	The finish is unfortunately only a short sea breeze. A little sweetish, but still dominantly salty.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/clynelish-14-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:02 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:02 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/clynelish-14.png
Ardnamurchan AD 04.22:02	Ardnamurchan	46.8	48				With the AD/04.22:02 release, the young Highland distillery Ardnamurchan once again demonstrates its commitment to transparency. This single malt is composed of ex-bourbon, American and Spanish Oloroso, as well as American and Spanish PX casks from the 2015 and 2016 vintages. Bottled in 2022 at 46.8% ABV, it is non-chill filtered and natural in colour – in true Ardnamurchan fashion.	The first impression is shaped by cool smoke that doesn’t dominate but blends gently with other notes. Fresh popcorn and a subtle herbal character emerge, joined by a hint of chalk. A bright, fresh citrus note stands out prominently. A touch of vanilla adds roundness, while a faint red fruit note—reminiscent of raspberry—lingers in the background. The overall profile is pleasantly maritime.	On the palate, the whisky comes across as fruity and fresh. Lime takes the lead, delivering a pronounced citrus impact. A subtle salty note adds depth, accompanied by a hint of minerality. The texture is creamy and soft. A gentle smoky layer floats through the mouth, enhancing the overall complexity without overpowering the palate.	The finish is medium in length. Dark chocolate comes to the fore, paired with a pleasant spiciness. A note of bitter orange provides a mildly tangy conclusion.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ardnamurchan-ad-04-22-02-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:02 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:02 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ardnamurchan-ad-04-22-02.png
Port Charlotte 2023 14 Year Old - Brühler Whiskyhaus	Bruichladdich	56.2	169				Another highlight of the series?	The first sniff takes you on a journey: mildly smoky notes of BBQ and ham blend with red fruits, including blackcurrants, adding a fresh and fruity touch. Hints of vanilla and caramel provide a pleasant sweetness, harmoniously rounding off the bouquet.	On the palate, the 14-year-old Port Charlotte reveals its full-bodied complexity. The subtle smoke remains present, accompanied by light earthy tones and a hint of maritime breeze, reminiscent of salty waves. The BBQ sauce and ham notes from the nose return, adding memorable depth to the flavor.	The finish is long and layered. Spicy oak notes dominate at first, gradually giving way to a light fruity sweetness, providing a well-rounded conclusion.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/port-charlotte-2023-14-year-old-bruehler-whiskyhaus	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:21 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:21 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/port-charlotte-2023-14-year-old-bruehler-whiskyhaus.png
anCnoc 18 Year Old 2024	Knockdhu	46	87				How good is it?	From the first nosing, the whisky's 18 years in oak casks are unmistakable. A warm spiciness rises, underscored by sweet almonds and dried orange peel. Light leather and subtle banana chips add an elegant depth. In the background, a touch of honey rounds out the aromatic spectrum.	On the palate, the anCnoc 18 Year Old is creamy yet dry. European oak asserts itself with prominent tannins, giving the whisky structure and fullness. Fruity notes of apricot and juicy raisins meet delicate milk chocolate. Dates provide a gentle sweetness, harmoniously blending with the whisky’s woody foundation.	The finish is medium-length and warming, characterized by toasted oak and a pleasant spiciness from white pepper. A hint of raisins lingers on the tongue, accompanied by a touch of baking cocoa. A satisfying finale that invites the next sip.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ancnoc-18-year-old-2024-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:22 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:22 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ancnoc-18-year-old-2024.png
Aberfeldy 40 Year Old 1983/2023 - Malts of Scotland	Aberfeldy	47.2	899				How good is it?	Aberfeldy 40 Year Old unleashes a true explosion of flavours from the very first nosing. Bright fruits, such as quince and pomegranate, open the bouquet, followed by an intense mélange of strong oak tones. Sweet notes of marzipan and forest honey round off the profile, while floral accents of lilac and daisies provide an extraordinary complexity. The oak is omnipresent, surrounding the sweet fruit and giving the whisky a spicy depth that is almost overwhelming in its complexity.	The complexity continues on the palate. Dried peaches and shortbread form the sweet base, while white bread and old oak provide a savoury, almost creamy texture. The balance between velvety spiciness and an almost bacony note reminiscent of lard makes this Highlander a unique experience. It is as if time itself has softened the whisky without taking away its characterful structure.	The finish is long and characterised by a spicy oak presence. Bright dried fruit flavours flash up again and accompany the finish, which is moderately spectacular but still very pleasant. This whisky finishes on an elegant but rather restrained note that emphasises its high level of maturity.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/aberfeldy-40-year-old-1983-2023-malts-of-scotland	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:20 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:20 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/aberfeldy-40-1983-2023-malts-of-scotland.png

Talisker Skye	Talisker	45.8	28				Is it an alternative to the 10?	As soon as you hold the glass to your nose, you immediately realise: Yes, this is Talisker! But a somewhat younger representative. Instead of deep, heavy smoke, you get a gentle peaty note that is more reminiscent of a distant campfire on the beach. This is joined by white pepper, classic bourbon cask notes such as vanilla, caramel and toffee as well as an interesting salty sea breeze. A slight seaweed note resonates, and on top of that there is a pinch of BBQ peanuts and a hint of honey. All in all, a round but somewhat lighter nose that makes you want to take your first sip.	The first sip makes it clear that Talisker Skye is going its own way. Surprisingly, a clear peach note appears first, which is almost tropical. Then comes a slightly bitter spiciness, which is accompanied by oak and a salty, maritime freshness. The mouthfeel is quite creamy, which makes the whisky pleasantly smooth. Spicy accents of rye bread and a slight sharpness provide a nice counterbalance to the fruity sweetness.	This shows that the Talisker Skye is younger than its 10-year-old brother. The finish is rather short, but still remains interesting. A mineral note, paired with the typical Talisker salinity, dominates the finish. A hint of mealy apple rounds off the whole thing before the flavours quickly fade away.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/talisker-skye-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:03 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:03 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/talisker-skye.png
Highland Park 15 Year Old Viking Heart	Highland Park	44	95				How good is it?	We first perceive intense cold smoke, which slowly fades away. After a few minutes in the glass, we smell fruity aromas, partly sweet, partly sour. It reminds us of grapefruit. In between, we have a slightly sandy, slightly dusty feeling in the nose. We can't quite put our finger on it.	Starting out fruity and tart and reminiscent of lemons and limes, brown sugar and vanilla sugar quickly take over. And that's it.	Medium-long and spicy, the 15 year old takes us on a finish that is initially very salty and tangy, but is later strongly dominated by toasted oak.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/highland-park-15-year-old-viking-heart	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:49:54 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:49:54 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/highland-park-15-viking-heart.png
Roseisle 12 Year Old Origami Kite 2 - Diageo Special Releases 2024	Roseisle	55.6	128				The Diageo Special Releases bring some of the most exciting bottlings to the market every year. In 2024, the Roseisle 12 Year Old Origami Kite 2 is a whisky from a distillery that was only founded in 2010 and has barely made an appearance as a single malt to date. Scepticism is appropriate - especially with a proud price that competes with established Speyside classics.	The first impression is characterised by a warm maltiness that combines with honey-like aromas. Apple crumble brings a beautiful, buttery-fruity component into play, while fresh wood and mint provide a certain lightness. A subtle candyfloss note lends the whisky a gentle sweetness. Overall, a pleasant, typical Speyside profile, but without any major surprises.	On the palate, the Roseisle 12 Year Old is unexpectedly herbal, which gives it an interesting, slightly bitter flavour. This is followed by a creamy vanilla ice cream sweetness, which is quickly overlaid by strong oak and spicy ginger. Forest honey provides a pleasant depth and a buttery croissant note gives the whisky a certain elegance. The 55.6% ABV is well integrated, but still gives the whisky a noticeable strength.	The finish is long, spicy and dry, with dominant oak and an interesting mix of apricot, sandalwood and cinnamon. A slight white pepper note provides additional spiciness. Not spectacular, but a solid and aromatically well-balanced finish.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/roseisle-12-year-old-origami-kite-2-diageo-special-releases-2024-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:13 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:13 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/roseisle-12-year-old-origami-kite-2-diageo-special-releases-2024.png
Caol Ila 12 Year Old	Caol Ila	43	40				How good is it?	The 12-year-old single malt opens with a cold medicinal smoke. Campfires and burnt-out coals come to mind. Light citrus notes follow, as well as mineral notes. The scotch smells very clean. Not intense - rather restrained.	This Islay malt opens almost creamy and surprisingly sweet. Later, the smokiness takes over. Very pleasant notes of sea asparagus and oatmeal are on the tongue. Light, not intrusive and maritime, all parts of the palate are reached.	Phenolic citrus fruits and a slightly spicy oak note remain. The smoke lingers in the medium-long finish.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/caol-ila-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/caol-ila-12.png
Ledaig 2005/2022 16 Year Old - Signatory Vintage	Tobermory	66.1	240				Ledaig 2005/2022 Signatory Vintage in the test: A 16-year-old, intense peated whisky with 66.1% ABV.Fruit, smoke, BBQ and maritime character	It's clear from the first sniff: here comes a heavyweight.Bacon, barbecue smoke and maritime salt notes immediately dominate. It smells as if you are standing right next to a smoker grill on the coast, while the wind carries a mixture of charcoal and sea air.  But there is more to this intense first impression. With a little time in the glass, BBQ sauce, honey and a hint of espresso unfold - a sweet and spicy depth that rounds off the flavour.The smoked almonds, which add a slightly nutty, oily note, are particularly exciting.  And then there's that slightly earthy, dirty undertone that's so typical of Ledaig - as if you've just rolled your hands in wet peat. Fascinating and intense!	No surprise: at 66.1%, this whisky packs a punch. But despite the high alcohol strength, it is surprisingly complex. Voluminous, oily and powerful, it rolls over the tongue as if it were clawing its way into every corner of the mouth.  The first impression is fruity and salty, almost as if you were tasting grilled peaches with a pinch of sea salt. But the BBQ wave sets in the very next moment: smoke, ham, charcoal, paired with a certain rubbery note and a slight hint of iodine.  What makes it special: the flavours from the nose are perfectly reflected in the taste - nothing falls apart, nothing seems disharmonious. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and with impressive intensity.	After such a brute start, one might expect a long, epic finish - but here the Ledaig surprises. Although the smoke remains noticeable, the finish is relatively short overall. What remains is a mixture of fruity and smoky notes, with a gentle echo of charcoal and salt.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ledaig-2005-2022-16-year-old-signatory-vintage	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:00 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:00 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ledaig-2005-2022-16-year-old-signatory-vintage.png
Tomatin 2009/2021 - Gordon & MacPhail	Tomatin	43	45				Approachable but not boring – this Highland single malt shows what independent bottlers like Gordon & MacPhail can draw out of a distillery like Tomatin. The Discovery range is designed as an accessible entry point into different whisky styles – smoky, sherried, or fruity. This 2009 Tomatin clearly belongs to the fruity corner – and delivers just that.	A friendly and inviting nose with ripe apples, floral notes, and soft vanilla. Beneath that lie hints of fresh hay and raw cookie dough. Nothing too complex, but clean and pleasant.	Surprisingly spicy for 43% ABV, with malty sweetness, honey, a slight waxy texture, and a noticeable oak presence. The mouthfeel is soft but substantial – this isn’t a thin whisky.	The finish is medium in length, slightly bitter and sweet, with a final echo of gentle fruitiness. The oak lingers but doesn’t overwhelm.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tomatin-2009-2021-gordon-amp-macphail-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:07 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:07 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tomatin-2009-2021-gordon-macphail.png
Glenfiddich 12 Year Old	Glenfiddich	40	27				How good is it?	Sweetly, the Scotch reminds us of bright fruits, such as ripe pears and apples. A hint of honey is perceptible in the background. Like the bottle - an elegantly balanced composition.	Not too complex and rather straightforward, we taste mild and balanced fresh fruits. A light honey aroma also crystallises.	Very briefly, a little oak and a slight bitterness remain.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenfiddich-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:49:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:49:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenfiddich-12.png
Annandale 2017/2020 ManOSword Founders Selection Cask 348	Annandale	60.6	96				How good is it?	With a neat cold, medicinal and iodine-like smoke, the single cask whisky ManOSword by Annandale greets us in the nose. Shortly after the olfactory receptors get used to the smoke, coconut and almond aromas follow, layered with bark mulch and a fresh potting soil. This reminds us a little of the coconut-soil potting tablets you can get in any DIY store.	The more than 60% vol. highlight the flavours very clearly and manage to create a full and at the same time dusty mouthfeel. A true peat explosion. We clearly perceive some pineapple next to the peat-smoke. A little later, vanilla and peach follow with a slight saltiness and subliminal but not unpleasant spiciness.	What remains is strong peat-smoke, a peppery spiciness and a slight tingle.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/annandale-man-o-sword-founders-selection-cask-348-2017-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/annandale-manosword-348.png
Talisker Surge	Talisker	45.8	69				How good is it?	At first, we are greeted by a pleasant smoke. However, there is a sweet note that reminds us of roasted pine nuts. All in all, the peat smoke for which Talisker is renowned is much softer than in other bottlings. There is also clear vanilla, rounded off by the sweet and strong smell of freshly toasted crème brûlée.	The taste is mildly sweet at first, like a breakfast bun with butter. Behind this are fruity aromas of apple, pear and a little honey. The aroma quickly fades and gives way to a less complex maltiness.	The finish has the famous Talisker pepper note and a slight maritime saltiness. We feel transported to a campfire on a rocky coastal beach. Compared to the Talisker bottlings we know, however, it is rather dull and not particularly long-lasting.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/talisker-surge-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:37 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:37 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/talisker-surge.png
Glenmorangie The Quinta Ruban 14 Year Old	Glenmorangie	46	55				How good is it?	Upon the initial nosing, the Quinta Ruban reveals itself with the characteristic Glenmorangie aroma, though noticeably more robust. The sweet and tangy fragrance is interwoven with fruity nuances reminiscent of blood orange, grapefruit, and fig. Spicy notes of ground hazelnuts and a hint of dark chocolate also make their presence known.	On the palate, the Quinta Ruban presents itself in the manner typical of Glenmorangie: silky-smooth and oily. The influences of the port wine casks fully unfold here. The harmonious combination of citrusy sweetness and chocolate brings to mind a soft cake. A slightly herbal note, most reminiscent of mint, joins the symphony. In combination with the chocolate lingering on the palate, this creates a truly wonderful melange.	The finish is long and intense. Peppery spiciness, coupled with a generous dose of oak, lingers on the palate. Citrus notes and a subtle hint of baking cocoa or dark chocolate persist in the background.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenmorangie-the-quinta-ruban-14-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:33 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:33 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenmorangie-the-quinta-ruban-14.png
Kilchoman Batch Strength 2024	Kilchoman	57	64				The Kilchoman Batch Strength 2024 is a whisky for real Islay fans. With a full 57.0 % ABV and no age statement, the Kilchoman Distillery focuses on pure intensity here. Those who love peaty smoke, maritime notes and honest cask strength will get their money's worth - but does this whisky also have enough character to stand out from the competition?	From the very first nosing, the aroma of cold ashes rises to the nose, as if the campfire had just stopped smouldering. There is also a subtle hint of iodine, reminiscent of a fresh sea breeze. The fruity accents of green apple and lemon balm, which blend gently into the smoke, are surprising. A subtle vanilla note rounds off the flavour and gives it a slight, subliminal sweetness.	The whisky is oily and warming on the tongue. The ash dominance from the nose continues, paired with a dry, chalky note. This is joined by a hint of unripe peach, which adds a subtle freshness, while a fine saltiness is reminiscent of sea spray. The flavours are powerful, direct and uncompromising - typically Islay.	Kilchoman remains true to itself in the finish: voluminous smoke dominates, accompanied by a light oak note that gives the whisky some depth. A mineral component reminiscent of pebbles resonates and reinforces the earthy character. The intensity lasts a long time without changing significantly.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/kilchoman-batch-strength-2024-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:23 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:23 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/kilchoman-batch-strength-2024.png

Glen Moray Port Cask Finish	Glen Moray	40	19				Located in the heart of Scotland’s Speyside region, Glen Moray is known for approachable, fruit-driven whiskies. Since the grand opening of its visitor centre on July 6th, 2004, the distillery has continued to evolve while staying true to its roots. Interestingly, Glen Moray played a key role in the early days of wood finishing experiments — a technique that would later make Glenmorangie world-famous.  With the Port Cask Finish, Glen Moray presents a no-age-statement single malt matured in ex-bourbon barrels before receiving a finishing period in port wine casks. Bottled at a friendly 40% ABV, it's an ideal choice for those new to whisky.	Right from the first sniff, the whisky offers a warm and inviting aroma. Notes of white chocolate, a subtle wine-like character, and a gentle touch of leather emerge. Black cherries add fruity depth, supported by a pleasantly malty sweetness. The nose invites you to take that first sip.	On the palate, sweetness takes the lead — clearly showcasing the influence of the port cask. A light bitterness provides a nice balance. Hints of caramel and vanilla mingle with soft oak, and there’s a touch of youthful spirit that gives it a charming character rather than being a drawback.	The finish is short but harmonious. Grainy and bready notes linger, accompanied by a touch of spice and a final trace of fruity sweetness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-moray-port-cask-finish-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:06 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:06 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-moray-port-cask-finish.png
Glen Moray 1998/2017 19 Year Old - Malts of Scotland	Glen Moray	54.8	89				How good is it?	From the very first nosing, you realise that this whisky is not a light representative from Speyside. Musty notes, familiar from old wine cellars, immediately fill the nose. This is followed by an intense smell of leather, reminiscent of old leather furniture that tells stories of times gone by. These deep, earthy tones are accompanied by a hint of pepper, which adds spiciness. A slight nuttiness is added, but this is almost drowned out by the extra dry sultanas - the typical influence of the sherry cask is clearly noticeable here.  A hint of ash and burnt candle wick hovers in the background. These are notes that not everyone will like, but they give the Glen Moray 19 year old a strong, slightly smoky touch.	The first impression is intense and full-bodied, almost exuberant. The combination of dark chilli chocolate and baking cocoa brings with it a complex bitter note, which, however, blends perfectly with the high viscosity of the whisky. This mouthfeel is heavy and oily - you can clearly feel the 19 years of maturation.  An interesting side effect is the memory of an extinguished candle, a slightly waxy, almost burnt nuance that makes the flavour profile even more complex. The whisky comes across as bitter overall, which can be quite polarising.	A strong sulphur note, reminiscent of rotten eggs, leaves no doubt that this whisky is polarising. Pepper and a herbaceous, tobacco-like mate tea flavour linger long into the finish and reinforce the bitter, slightly rough character. An impression of wet towel remains, which - like the sulphur - is not suitable for every palate.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/malts-of-scotland-glen-moray-19-1998-2017-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:32 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:32 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/malts-of-scotland-glen-moray-19-1998-2017.png
Wolfburn Vibrant Stills Sauternes Cask  2016/2024 8 Year Old	Wolfburn	50	74				Wolfburn, the northernmost distillery on the Scottish mainland, is known for its handcrafted and elegant whiskies. With the Vibrant Stills Sauternes Cask 2016/2024, they've once again delivered something exciting. Aged for 8 years – first in ex-bourbon, then in first-fill Sauternes wine casks from France – this release offers bright fruitiness with structure. Bottled exclusively for Germany, it’s definitely worth a closer look.	The nose is fresh, grassy, and green – like a spring meadow somewhere between a lemon grove and a haystack. There’s lime, green grapes, and a hint of nectarine. Dive deeper and you might even discover something like pineapple sponge cake. The wine influence is there, but it leans more bitter than sweet – intriguing!	On the palate, this whisky turns creamy. Nectarine, hints of passionfruit yogurt, and honey meet a surprisingly dry oaky spice. A touch of rye bread, maybe even beer-like notes come through. The fruit fades a little, replaced by structure – although the balance could be better.	The finish is medium, with a gentle tingle and warming feel. There’s a light spice and a hint of oak, but sadly, not much fruit left. It feels like the cask could have given just a bit more.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/wolfburn-vibrant-stills-sauternes-cask-2016-2024-8-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:43 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:43 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/wolfburn-vibrant-stills-sauternes-cask-2016-2024-8-year-old.png
Glendronach The Hielan 8 Year Old	Glendronach	46	32				How good is it?	The single malt is very expressive on the nose. The main notes are lemon peel and plum, as well as a little woody-woody-wood. In addition, a nice butter toast, cane sugar and a strong vanilla can be found.	The Highlander opens really, really velvety soft. Followed by powerful oak paired with orange marmalade and sandalwood, the Scotch transitions into a nuttiness (almonds, hazelnuts) before the development finds its conclusion in soft sugar biscuits. Fabulously delicious!	The finish is medium long and warming with spicy oak and a touch of maltiness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glendronach-the-hielan-8-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:49 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:49 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glendronach-the-hielan-8.png
Craigellachie 2013/2024 Margaux Cask London Showcase 2024 - Berry Bros. & Rudd	Craigellachie	54	95				How good is it?	When the glass is lifted for the first time, intense, fruity aromas emerge. The impression of fresh strawberry smoothie dominates the nose and is perfectly complemented by a creamy note of cream. This gives the whisky an almost dessert-like quality. Subtle notes of caramel and fig add depth, while the red forest berries provide freshness. The winey influence of the Margaux cask is particularly noteworthy. It brings an elegant, slightly tart note that balances the sweetness perfectly. As soon as you smell it, you realise that this whisky is more than just a typical Speyside single malt - it is a promise of complexity.	The first sip confirms the expectations and even exceeds them. The whisky starts with ripe plums and dark chocolate - a combination that provides depth and sensuality. But the experience does not end here: the pleasant oak tannins provide a tart counterpoint that balances out the sweetness of the malt notes. The red berries, which were already present in the aroma, also play a leading role in the flavour. They provide a fruity freshness that adds vibrancy to the heavy notes. The alcohol is perfectly integrated, adding an additional intensity without overwhelming the palate. Rather, it enhances the nuances and makes the Craigellachie 2013/2024 a multi-layered experience.	The finish is a highlight in itself. It lingers, warms the palate and unfolds a multi-faceted interplay of strong, slightly bitter oak and dark chocolate. A subtle, ‘dirty’ note - signature of Craigellachie - provides character and individuality. It is this slightly earthy quality that makes the whisky unmistakable and gives it a touch of wildness. The finish is perfectly balanced and leaves a pleasant, complex mouthfeel that invites you to take another sip.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/craigellachie-2013-2024-margaux-cask-berry-bros-rudd-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:28 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:28 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/craigellachie-2013-2024-margaux-cask-berry-bros-rudd.png
Glen Keith 21 Year Old	Glen Keith	43	168				How good is it?	On opening the bottle, the aroma of Glen Keith 21 Years is intense and fruity, with strong notes of peach and apricot. The whisky has a velvety smooth smell with sweet vanillin and marzipan notes. There is also a slight oak note that adds depth and complexity to the aroma.	On the palate, the Scotch has a rich and creamy mouthfeel. The predominant flavour is marzipan, with hints of green apple and other light fruit notes. There is also a slight toffee flavour as well as a honey sweetness.	The finish is long and sweet, with a strong presence of oak. The oak flavours add depth and complexity to the whisky and balance the sweetness and fruitiness of the other flavours.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-keith-21-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:54 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:54 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-keith-21.png
Glenfiddich 23 Year Old 2023 Rude Olph - VAME Malts	Glenfiddich	47.2	139				The Scottish Glenfiddich distillery is one of the best-known names in the whisky world, but this bottling is something special: a 23-year-old drop, bottled by VAME Malts. The ‘Rude Olph’ promises a combination of tradition and a breath of fresh air. Will it live up to this promise? Let's find out!	The first impression? Sherry all the way! A pleasant aroma of dates and plums immediately hits the nose - ripe, dark fruit that makes you want more. This is accompanied by honey and a malty sweetness that is wonderfully balanced. After a few moments in the glass, vanilla, raspberries and even a hint of pumpkin reveal themselves. A slightly vinous touch rounds off the bouquet and adds complexity.	The first sip makes it clear that the ‘Rude Olph’ remains true to its flavour. Pumpkin and a pleasantly sweet fruitiness dominate the opening, accompanied by a hint of sultanas and biscuits. This combination feels almost cosy, like an autumn day by the fireplace. Malt also plays a key role and adds a lovely, sweet and warm note. The whisky is very mild and accessible - perfect for beginners, but experienced connoisseurs will also appreciate the harmonious balance.	Here, the whisky shows yet another facet: the finish is warming, slightly oaky and ends with a surprising note of burnt toast. This nuance gives the whole thing a little character without being too overpowering.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenfiddich-2023-23-year-old-rude-olph-vame-malts-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenfiddich-2023-23-year-old-rude-olph-vame-malts.png
Tullibardine 500	Tullibardine	43	34				How good is it?	Vanilla and malt open the nose of this Highland whisky. A hint of sherry paired with butterscotch merges with fermented fruit (apple, pear), giving it a slightly acidic flavour.	The whisky is soft and creamy, almost watery on the tongue. The classic fig and date flavours from the sherry cask would round off the taste well if it weren't for the disturbing ethanol note. Too bad.	Unfortunately, the 500's finish is short and bitter.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tullibardine-500-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:28 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:28 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tullibardine-500.png
Kilkerran 2024 8 Year Old Batch 10	Glengyle	57.4	83				Kilkerran is known for its raw, honest whiskies - and this 8-year-old Batch 10 is no exception. At a whopping 57.4% ABV, it packs quite a punch, but behind the strength lies a sophisticated blend of smoke, spice and sweetness.	The first impression? Herbal spice meets a pinch of curcuma - exotic, but not overpowering. There is also a slight hint of peat smoke, which combines elegantly with blossom honey. But then it comes: a bacony undertone with an almost medicinal note, reminiscent of bath concentrate with spruce needles. Sounds wild? It is - but in a really good way!	Sweet red fruits open the game, but a decent volume of smoke is quickly added. The whisky is oily, full-bodied and has an astringent dryness that creates tension. Brown sugar rounds off the whole and lends a pleasant sweetness that blends wonderfully into the overall picture.	Clearly earthy, with a dry, almost dusty smokiness reminiscent of a BBQ that has gone out. A finish with character that doesn't disappear too quickly.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/kilkerran-2024-8-year-old-batch-10	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/kilkerran-2024-8-year-old-batch-10.png
Royal Brackla 10 Year Old 2014/2024 - James Eadie	Royal Brackla	46	40				How good is it?	A fruity whirlwind hits you from the very first sniff. Red, ripe apples push their way to the front as if they were about to climb out. They are accompanied by juicy red grapes and a hint of redcurrants - a fruit basket par excellence! But that's not all: a pleasant maltiness and a hint of effervescence ensure that the nose not only sniffs, but dances. Bright fruits and a hint of citrus round off the experience.	One sip and you're at the Christmas market - but not at just any stall, but at the crêpes! The sweetness of cinnamon and sugar harmonises with a creamy apple sauce aroma, as if the best autumn flavours had been captured in a bottle. The whisky feels oily and full-bodied, nestling comfortably on the palate, wonderfully carried by the 46% ABV.	After the last sip, the Royal Brackla remains present for a long time. A slight ginger kick provides a welcome spiciness, which is complemented by subtle oak notes and a hint of dryness. A fine nuttiness floats along.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/royal-brackla-10-year-old-2014-2024-james-eadie	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:27 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:27 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/royal-brackla-10-2014-2024-james-eadie.png
Dailuaine 10 Year Old - 82 Chapters to Newcastle	Dailuaine	55.6	60				How good is it?	The first thing we notice is the fruity scent of ripe peaches. There are also intense notes of Speyside - sweet wild honey and a strong malty sweetness. The fruit sweetness then gives way to overripe apples, surrounded by the scent of caramelised sweets. There is also a hint of red wine in the glass.	On the tip of the tongue, an intense sweet caramel note dominates. This quickly gives way to a great fruitiness. We Phil reminded of wild berries, cranberries and once again the typical Speyside honey. On the dry palate we find mint, some ginger and a really nice kick of white pepper.	The medium-long Philnish of the single malt is dominated by a nice oak spiciness. Again, a small amount of ginger, dark chocolate and a hint of fig.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/82-chapters-to-new-castle-phil-dailuaine-10-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:40 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:40 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/82-chapters-to-new-castle-phil-dailuaine-10.png
Ben Nevis 2013/2024 10 Year Old - Dràm Mòr	Ben Nevis	57.4	90				How good is it?	The opening on the nose is characterized by intense maltiness. A fascinating blend of sweet scents evokes memories of roasted marshmallows and milk chocolate. Over time, the aroma unfolds into more robust notes. A hint of old leather becomes perceptible, and the chocolate note evolves towards bittersweet. In the background, a subtle notion of blackcurrants emerges. Top notes carry a touch of honey and vanilla.	Notably, the malt exhibits a pronounced dry mouthfeel. Coupled with its high oiliness, it imparts a distinctive astringency to the whisky. On the palate, it presents a spicy-oaky profile with subtle hints of forest honey on the tip of the tongue. These harmoniously evolve into typical Sherry notes of forest berries and chocolate, where the 'Sherry bomb' is present in flavor but not overpowering. Towards the back it reveals an almost mineral note reminiscent of tobacco leaves.	The finish of this Ben Nevis is medium-length and warming, with the image of an old leather sofa consistently present. Here, a persistent honey note remains, while the conclusion is pleasantly spicy, accompanied by zesty white pepper.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ben-nevis-10-dram-mor-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:31 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:31 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ben-nevis-10-dram-mor.png
Lagavulin 2024 11 Year Old Offerman 4th Edition	Lagavulin	46	95				When it comes to Islay whiskies, there are two types of people: Those who love the intense smoke, and those who wonder if their glass has been matured in a bonfire. The Lagavulin 2024 11 Year Old Offerman 4th Edition is aimed at the former - those who see the scent of cold smoke and salty sea breeze as an invitation rather than a warning. This fourth collaboration between Nick Offerman and Lagavulin promises a typical Islay malt with a touch of originality.	Raise your glass and you are immediately transported into a world of cold smoke and gentle sea spray. There is a slight hint of iodine, just as you would expect from a Lagavulin. But there is more: a gentle vanilla sweetness provides balance, accompanied by subtle citrus accents and an almost floral freshness. A hint of menthol-like ice candy flashes up and brings a cool, slightly minty note into play. The flavour is unmistakably Islay, but with a little Offerman twist.	The smoke remains present on the tongue, but it does not dominate the entire experience. Instead, the whisky opens with a pleasant fruitiness - pear and apple provide a subtle sweetness that elegantly complements the smoky foundation. The texture is soft, almost creamy, with a slightly ashy undertone reminiscent of cooled charcoal. Lagavulin shows a somewhat more accessible side here, without losing its Islay character.	The finish is long, voluminous and expressive. Oaky notes prevail, accompanied by a gentle peppery flavour - white pepper briefly tickles the palate before a hint of icing sugar joins in and rounds off the finish with a mild sweetness. It is a classic Islay finish, but without the brutal force that some younger bottlings bring.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lagavulin-2024-11-year-old-offermann-4	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:20 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:20 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lagavulin-2024-11-year-old-offerman-4th-edition.png
Oban Hand Filled Distillery Exclusive 11 Year Old Batch 1	Oban	53.8	140				How good is it?	The Oban 11 year old in cask strength seduces with fresh vanilla, floral nuances and sweet honey. Hay-like elements and fruity notes of apple and pear harmonise with an exotic coconut note. A splash of lemon frees the nose, while a surprising olive adds depth to the bouquet. Fresh and intense.	After an inspiring nose, the single malt impresses with its creamy texture, dry intensity and nutty charm. Salty accents in the throat complement the sweet vanilla, honeydew melon and delicate caramel flavour. A hint of white pepper with walnut on the palate completes the flavour experience.	The finish of the whisky is surprisingly long and intense, carried by fine fresh oak and a pot of white tea. You don't really get that kind of length and intensity from a pure bourbon cask bottling. The warming note is skilfully accompanied by an astringent character.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/oban-distillery-exclusive-handfilled-11-batch-1-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:32 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:32 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/oban-distillery-exclusive-handfilled-11-1.png
Highland Park 2006/2024 18 Year Old - Signatory Vintage	Highland Park	52	107				An 18-year-old Highland Park bottled by Signatory Vintage – sounds intriguing, doesn’t it? What makes this release even more exciting is that it’s not another 'Secret Orkney,” but a genuine Highland Park, showcasing the distillery’s signature style. On paper, it promises a lot – but does it deliver? Let’s find out.	The first sniff unveils a wonderfully complex bouquet: freshly cut grass, sun-dried hay, and a subtle maltiness set the stage. Fruity undertones follow – think a basket of ripe fruits, led by baked apples. There’s a delicate, pleasant smokiness intertwined with a maritime breeze that completes this aromatic symphony.	The palate keeps the intrigue alive with its distinctive maritime foundation. Ripe apples and a touch of caramel add sweetness, while hay and a slight chalky note provide a grounding earthiness. Despite its 52 % ABV, the whisky feels incredibly smooth and well-rounded – a testament to its exceptional balance.	The finish is as rewarding as the palate. Notes of candied apples and a hint of honey meet a gentle peatiness. This peat doesn’t overwhelm but rather adds depth and volume, lingering gracefully on the tongue and inviting another sip.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/highland-park-2006-2024-18-year-old-signatory-vintage	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:14 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:14 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/highland-park-2006-2024-18-year-old-signatory-vintage.png

Craigellachie 2012/2023 10 Year Old - Signatory Vintage	Craigellachie	67.4	60				What does the Sherry Beast do?	From the very first nosing, the sherry flavour literally leaps out at you. Sultanas and grilled bacon dates dominate the flavour, accompanied by a deep, leathery note reminiscent of fresh saddle leather. These are joined by chestnuts and a hint of cardamom, which add a spicy complexity. A malty bread crust also resonates, giving the whisky an additional savoury component. Although the high alcohol strength is noticeable, it does not burn aggressively, but carries the flavours with strength and elegance.	On the palate, Craigellachie is powerful and sweet, almost like a BBQ glaze on grilled meat. The sultana and date notes from the aroma continue, embedded in a strong leather structure. This is joined by a subtle roasted note reminiscent of slightly burnt sugar. Despite its strength, the whisky remains balanced - the cask gives the distillate a deep, savoury sweetness without overpowering it. With a little time in the glass, a slight dryness develops, rounding off the experience.	The finish is long, warming and complex. A combination of fruity sweetness and strong oak remains present for a long time, accompanied by a slightly bitter finish. Notes of red wine and a subtle spiciness provide additional depth.

Tullibardine Sovereign	Tullibardine	43	30				How good is it?	The Sovereign is very faint on the nose. Somewhat oaky and malty, a little vanilla here and there and a hint of pear. Half a spoonful of apricot yoghurt.	The flavour is also relatively 'compact'. Also oak and vanilla. Instead of great flavours, we encounter hardly any fruit and more ethanol, which makes it tingling.	The finish is short with a hint of cinnamon and some oaky spice.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tullibardine-sovereign-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:29 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:29 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tullibardine-sovereign.png
Ben Nevis 2013 10 Year Old Mingle into darkness Cask 78.84 - The Scotch Malt Whisky Society	Ben Nevis	67.3	87				Some whiskies are like a relaxing evening stroll - gentle, cosy, predictable. And then there are bottlings like the Ben Nevis 2013 from cask 78.84 of the Scotch Malt Whisky Society: a wild ride through dense flavours, strong sherry influences and a concentrated load of oak spice.	From the very first sniff, it is clear that a lot is happening here! A wave of dark berries meets a tart freshness reminiscent of blackberries and a hint of lemon. At the same time, a deep sweetness resonates - brown sugar mixes with fresh hay and a hint of crusty bread. Everything seems extremely concentrated, almost compressed, as if the barrel has condensed all the flavours into a very small space over the years.	The first sip? A powerful start. Malty sweetness covers the tongue like a velvety film, followed by a mixture of red fruits, creamy coconut notes and voluminous oak. The power of the old sherry cask is immediately noticeable here: spice, strength and depth dominate without tipping the whisky into extremes. The balance between sweet malt, berry freshness and heavy oak notes makes it an exciting powerhouse.	Long, warming and dry. The fruitiness gives way to a spicy mixture of cinnamon, tobacco and a hint of cranberry. Over time, a pleasant bitterness develops that is reminiscent of dark chocolate and brings the whole thing to an elegant close.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ben-nevis-2013-10-year-old-mingle-into-darkness-cask-78-84-the-scotch-malt-whisky-society	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ben-nevis-2013-10-year-old-mingle-into-darkness-cask-78-84-the-scotch-malt-whisky-society.png
Glenmorangie 10 Year Old	Glenmorangie	40	33				How good is it?	Vanilla, fruity, fresh. Very summery and soft, we smell light fruits, a little nut. A very clear vanilla note hovers over everything. A very clear aroma profile that is pursued here. 'You know what this reminds me of? Jam.' / 'No, it's clearly jelly to me!' So much for that.	The taste is also quite clearly defined. We think of almonds, apricot, cotton candy. Sweetish malty and very soft, mild flavors make us think of summer.	Medium length says goodbye to a slight oakiness in combination with white wine.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenmorangie-10-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:49:49 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:49:49 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenmorangie-10.png
Knockando Richly Matured 15 Year Old - 2005	Knockando	43	42				How good is it?	Forest floor with a blob of mashed potatoes. With far too much nutmeg and a musty muskiness. Somehow there is also a bit of sherry and oak in there. There are also slight roasted aromas and something fruity hidden somewhere. A very strange combination.	Spicy and oaky, the Knockando 15 year turns into a fruity but malty sweetness. The fruitiness reminds us a little of baked apple pie. This single malt is not suitable for beginners. A very complex taste experience that gains in sweetness from sip to sip.	The 'Richly Matured' Whisky accompanies us for a long time, sweetly spicy and warming.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/knockando-richly-matured-15-year-old-2005	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:49:48 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:49:48 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/knockando-richly-matured-15.png
Royal Brackla 10 Year Old 2014/2024 - Thompson Bros	Royal Brackla	55.3	65				Royal Brackla 10 Years Old from Thompson Bros surprises with malty elegance and floral finesse! This Highland malt proves that even unknown gems can shine.	The very first swirl in the glass reveals the impressive complexity of this Royal Brackla. The nose is very malty, forming a solid foundation of roasted grain reminiscent of freshly baked bread. Above this malty base, floral notes unfold, reminiscent of heather blossoms and delicate meadow flowers – typical of the Highland region and wonderfully balanced.  The lemon zest is particularly appealing, adding a fresh, lively note to the aroma profile without being overpowering. The sweet, oily texture of the aromas envelops the senses and carries a hint of vanilla that harmonises perfectly with the burnt toast. These roasted aromas are never bitter, but lend the whisky a comforting warmth. The overall impression on the nose is remarkably clean and rounded.	The oily, smooth texture caresses the mouth and carries the flavours with an almost buttery creaminess. The ginger stands out clearly and brings a pleasant, warming spiciness that perfectly complements the cask strength and never seems aggressive. The malty-sweet notes from the nose continue and are complemented by a surprisingly fruity component: candied pear is elegant and gives the whisky a subtle sweetness reminiscent of high-quality patisserie. This fruitiness is not overpowering, but blends harmoniously into the overall picture and ensures a perfect balance between malt, spices and sweet elements.	The ginger flavour continues on the palate, creating a warming effect that spreads pleasantly throughout the mouth and throat. The oak profile that emerges in the finish is particularly impressive – not too dominant, but present enough to make the 10 years of ageing noticeable. The medium-length finish is just right and is rounded off by a slightly herbal note that is strikingly reminiscent of Ricola lemon.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/royal-brackla-10-year-old-2014-2024-thompson-bros-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/royal-brackla-10-year-old-2014-2024-thompson-bros.png

Glen Scotia 10 Year Old unpeated	Glen Scotia	40	28				Is it worth buying?	When first immersed in the world of Glen Scotia 10 Year Old Unpeated, the senses are met with flavours of vanilla, caramel toffee and a hint of citrus. However, a strange note lurks beneath the surface, a musty presence that slightly dulls the fragrance experience.	On the palate, Glen Scotia reveals an unexpected range of flavours, from a wet towel and old, soft McDonald's fries to a subtle maritime saltiness. However, despite the variety of flavours, the Scotch lacks the fruitiness one would expect from a whisky of this type. Instead, an unpleasant hint of mustiness lingers in the mouth.	The finish is disappointing. Barely existent, it leaves only a slight bitterness and a rough texture on the tongue, which reinforces the impression of an unfinished whisky.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-scotia-10-year-old-unpeated	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-scotia-10-unpeated.png
Ardbeg Scorch Committee Release	Ardbeg	51.7	116				How good is it?	The opening is, as expected, biting. Intense BBQ and campfire aromas. A certain meaty, tar-like quality is rounded out by sweet vanilla notes. For us, the malt is (unusually for Ardbeg) slightly medicinal.	The taste is - after smelling - surprisingly sweet. Vanilla and caramel nestle with intense oak and the taste of burnt toast. Dryness and pepper spice complement the sweetness on the palate.	The intense Scorch stays in the mouth for a long time. Intensely woody with smoke and ash, it becomes a bit rubbery at the back.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ardbeg-scorch-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:57 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:57 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ardbeg-scorch.png
Springbank 10 Year Old	Springbank	46	75				Is the hype justified?	The first impression is slightly alcoholic and rather simple. After a while in the glass, the flavours unfold. The usual salty, dirty earthiness of Springbank whiskies spreads out. The flavours then move towards amaretto, marzipan and almonds. A subtle layer of smoke hovers above this. If you allow more time to pass, the nose takes on a sweetish flavour. We think of blossom and forest honey, as well as butter biscuits and white tea. Now and again, there are hints of spicy oak.	We find many delicate and well-balanced flavours in the taste. Light smoke is present again. However, as in the nose, this remains more of a subtle companion. Now it starts with a pleasant fruit acidity, with lots of oak and a good portion of dried fruit. Accompanied by sea asparagus. A few sips later, aromas of banana chips, honey and almost burnt almonds dominate the flavour, which can be described as round and mild.	The malty finish is of medium length and brings sweet almonds, spicy oak and a little pepper kick.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/springbank-10-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:20 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:20 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/springbank-10.png
Ben Nevis 10 Year Old 2014/2024 - James Eadie	Ben Nevis	58.9	74				How good is it?	The first impression? A sultana explosion straight to the face - like opening a bag of Christmas cheer! Caramel and soft oak emphasise this sweet and spicy base, while earthier notes of tobacco and brown sugar tickle the nose. If you sniff closely, you will even detect a hint of peanuts, which gives the fragrance a nutty depth.	The whisky is viscous, almost syrupy on the tongue - a mouthfeel that triggers feelings of pure luxury. Malty notes dominate at the beginning before a symphony of sultanas, dates and candied apple unfolds. A touch of caramel provides a pleasant sweetness, while the nutty peanut flavour provides a contrast. Anyone who enjoys rich, full-bodied whiskies could go into raptures here.	Medium length with roasted almonds and cloves. Candied fruit adds a spicy twist, and there is a sudden flash of tropical freshness from mango and papaya.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ben-nevis-10-year-old-2014-2024-james-eadie	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:22 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:22 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ben-nevis-10-2014-2024-james-eadie.png
Craigellachie 2013/2024 - Malts of Scotland	Craigellachie	61.2	59				Malts of Scotland is known for its bold and characterful releases, and this one is no exception: a Craigellachie at 61.2% ABV, straight from the cask, unfiltered and untouched. After 11 years in the cask, this Speyside whisky has turned into a true sherry bomb.	Right from the start, this whisky delivers a whirlwind of aromas. Plums, figs, and dates create an intense sweetness, while morello cherries add a darker fruit note. There are also hints of leather, tobacco, and something reminiscent of a long-heated grain pillow – warm, spicy, and slightly nutty.	The first sip is a full-on sherry explosion. Sweet, fruity flavors dominate the tip of the tongue before transitioning into old leather sofas, Cognac-like notes, and tobacco leaves. The texture is creamy, almost oily, yet it quickly dries out. Aged oak brings a strong spiciness, while slightly burnt notes add a smoky-bitter accent. Somewhere in between, rust and machine oil play a subordinate role.	Long and intense. The oak spice builds up further, but the sweetness remains – this time more like heather honey and caramel. The whisky fades out with dry, spicy oak, leaving a lingering warmth.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/craigellachie-2013-2024-malts-of-scotland-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:19 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:19 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/craigellachie-2013-2024-malts-of-scotland.png
Lagavulin 16 Year Old	Lagavulin	43	74				How good is it?	On the nose, Lagavulin 16 always reminds us of an old leather sofa in a dark corner with an oak table on which berries are standing. We smell strong peat smoke, iodine and earth. A berry note coats various sweet smoky aromas with a certain saltiness at the edge.	Peat smoke spreads softly and very intensively. The following sweetness, which covers everything, is gradually replaced by a maritime saltiness. Later, a light oak note and, with a little imagination, a kind of crème brûlée become perceptible. The composition reminds us a little of slightly burnt wholemeal spelt toast.	Full and with lots of salt and peat smoke, the Lagavulin 16 years says goodbye. It lingers for a long time.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lagavulin-16-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:18 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:18 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lagavulin-16.png
Cardhu 12 Year Old	Cardhu	40	30				How good is it?	On the nose, the whisky brings the classic notes of a Speysider: Vanilla, caramel, apple and honey are dominant, while some nutty flavours lie in the background.	We taste very old, very old oatmeal biscuits, which make us think of the Kinder Country commercial from the 90s. Woody, bitter notes resonate. Slowly and viscously, a little caramel can be perceived and, with a little imagination, hazelnuts can also be found. We don't find the fruitiness from the nose.	Slightly bitter, slightly woody and with something strange on the palate, the single malt finishes with some warming spiciness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/cardhu-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:59 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:59 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/cardhu-12.png
Glenturret Triple Wood Release 2024	Glenturret	44	42				Does it live up to expectations?	The first impression is pleasant and layered. Malty notes form the foundation, while dark chocolate and fruity hints of apple and pear add variety. Vanilla subtly lingers in the background, providing a creamy touch. The nose is not overly intense but present and inviting.	The initial sip is distinctly malty before a refreshing citrus note takes over. Cinnamon brings a certain spiciness that blends with toffee and a mix of light and dark fruits. The 'wild fruit mix” is particularly intriguing, difficult to pinpoint but adding a dynamic character to the whisky. A spicy oak note provides structure, and the texture has a slight tingle – a pleasant interplay between sweetness and spice.	The finish is marked by solid oak notes, yet remains pleasantly rounded due to soft tannins. A light ginger kick adds a fresh spiciness, while the aftertaste fades slowly with a mix of wood and warm spices.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenturret-triple-wood-release-2024-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:21 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:21 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenturret-triple-wood-release-2024.png
Glenlossie 12 Year Old 2009/2021 - Malts of Scotland	Glenlossie	57.3	85				How good is it?	Christmas! Gingerbread, cinnamon and cloves dominate the nosing at first. A hint of honey wine flashes through briefly in places, but is quickly replaced by spices, dried fruit and plums. As if that wasn't enough, cranberries, dried cherries and yes - really - Nutella follow after some time in the glass.	We continue our visit to the Christmas market with caramel and the sweet, full-bodied flavour of red fruits and a juicy mango. Roasted almonds and star fruit are not to be missed. Cheekily, there is also a little chilli kick hiding in the corner. The alcohol is wonderfully integrated as an intense flavour carrier.	The Glenlossie remains long and warming with bitter dark chocolate and a little aniseed.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenlossie-12-year-old-malts-of-scotland	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:25 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:25 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenlossie-12-mos.png
Kilkerran 12 Year Old	Glengyle	46	49				How good is it?	On the nose, there is a sweet smoke that is not overdone. There is also a good amount of oak and a sweet nuttiness, almost like marzipan. Once you get used to the peatiness, the fruity notes of cherries, plums and blueberries come to the fore.	The first thing that strikes you about Kilkerran is its oiliness. On the palate we find honey, a hint of vanilla and citrus notes. There is also a maritime saltiness, earthy-sweet peat smoke and a touch of oak.	The finish is medium long, again salty and maritime. The oiliness leaves a pleasant sensation in the throat. We think of a fresh lemon roll.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/kilkerran-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:39 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:39 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/kilkerran-12.png
Royal Brackla 2009 Grown-Up Indulgences Cask 55.72 - The Scotch Malt Whisky Society	Royal Brackla	58.1	80				How good is it?	The Royal Brackla 2009 unfolds an opulent palette of flavours on the nose. A strong caramel flavour is dominant, mingling with a sugary-sweet, syrupy note. The sherry influences are unmistakable, with redcurrants in particular coming to the fore. This is accompanied by a strong oak note, which gives the whisky a robust structure.	Oaky and with a slightly ashy note, the 12-year-old Royal Brackla begins its journey. The consistency is oily and syrupy, which makes the mouthfeel pleasantly full-bodied. Fruity notes of sultanas and honey dates characterise the taste, accompanied by a tangy lemon note and a hint of redcurrant. Plum is also clearly perceptible, while a slight bitterness is noticeable in the background.	The finish of the Royal Brackla 2009 is long, intense and dry, with a lingering syrupy note. The feeling of chewing on a cask stave remains long after the last sip and once again emphasises the strong oak presence of this whisky.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/smws-grown-up-indulgences-royal-brackla-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:01 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:01 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/smws-grown-up-indulgences-royal-brackla.png

Cragganmore 12 Year Old	Cragganmore	40	31				How good is it?	We get a strong smell of honey and butterscotch in the nose. After a while, we notice malty cereal notes in the middle part, while floral notes opening up a little further back.	Our first impression here is semolina pudding with pear puree - very intense. The Scotch is malty sweet with a good portion of vanilla. Characterised by pleasant oak, we have a discreet wood smoke, which is rounded off by cereal notes.	We would describe the sweet-bitter, slightly woody-spicy finish as a short trip rather than a long journey.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/cragganmore-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/cragganmore-12.png
Aberfeldy 2021 18 Year Old French Red Wine Casks	Aberfeldy	43	98				If there's one thing a whisky from the Highlands promises, it's character - and the Aberfeldy 2021, 18 years in French Red Wine Casks doesn't disappoint. This limited bottling shows how a mature spirit can shine with a touch of French elegance.	Even the nosing of this whisky is an experience. Notes of dates and figs rise to the nose, carried by a gentle hint of light-coloured grapes and clove. An interesting ‘sandy’ undertone is reminiscent of a walk in an autumn landscape - earthy, slightly rough and inviting at the same time. After the first sip, increasingly fruity flavours unfold, intensifying the impression.	On the tongue, the Aberfeldy 18 year old is initially creamy - almost like a velvety wine. But then the Highlands make their unmistakable mark: oak and a hint of coloured pepper provide a spicy base, accompanied by subtle notes of red fruit. The slightly vinous note from the maturation in French red wine casks adds an elegant dimension without being too dominant.	And then comes the finish - wow! The interplay of flavours reaches its climax here. A clear strawberry note leads into raspberry ice cream before everything dissolves into a creamy, spicy warmth. The strong spiciness leaves a lasting impression that lingers on the palate for minutes afterwards.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/aberfeldy-2021-18-year-old-french-red-wine-casks-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/aberfeldy-2021-18-year-old-french-red-wine-casks.png
Tullibardine 228	Tullibardine	43	35				How good is it?	The single malt opens with raspberries, dark fruits and a little chocolate. This is joined by a little honey, vanilla and cherry. With a little imagination, hazelnuts can also be sensed.	Orange zest and chocolate, like a good dark chocolate with pieces of orange. The malt from the Highlands also offers hazelnut and raspberries - just like on the nose - and is pleasantly dry, like a good red wine.	The finish of the Highlander is medium-long, oaky-spicy and sweetish-winey.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tullibardine-228-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:28 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:28 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tullibardine-228.png

Octomore 10.3 2013 / 2019 6 Year Old	Bruichladdich	61.3	178				How good is it?	'For such a smoky one, it smells bright and fresh. Not like an Ardbeg ashtray.' was Sascha's first comment.Instead of the dark smoke, we have spring-like notes of lemon balm. We also smell freshly roasted coffee and boiled custard. Peat smoke is also present, of course.	What kind of sugar is that? We think of a very sugary cake with a massive layer of fondant. Somehow also peat smoke, but damn sweet. A variety of flavours were hiding underneath. On the one hand we have a salty marimality, on the other hand a slightly lemony-limey sourness. Very, very exciting.	Really warming and 'ultra long' we have smoked ham, rubber, spices, and iodine-like notes in the finish. For half an hour!	https://thewhiskyedition.com/octomore-10-3-2013-2019-6-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:49:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:49:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/octomore-10-3.png
Teaninich 2008/2021 - Signatory Vintage	Teaninich	46	44				How good is it?	Ricola lemon and herb sweets hit your nose as soon as you take a whiff - like spring in a Swiss Alpine meadow. The whole thing is accompanied by honey, lime zest and a fruit basket filled with pears and apples. Fruity, floral and somehow a little tart.	In the mouth, the whisky first greets us with a grassy and floral flavour - as if you had just walked through a freshly mown meadow. Suddenly the orange appears and gives the whole thing a sunny touch before a herbaceous tartness takes hold. Anyone who thinks this sounds too good is mistaken. Because here it comes: a small but subtle toffee attack - sweet caramel fudge meets light tingling effects. Sounds unusual? It is.	Unfortunately, the Teaninich finishes a little quicker than one would wish - the finish is rather short to medium-long. However, it leaves behind a final greeting of oak spice, vanilla, a hint of pepper and, as if that wasn't enough, a spicy ginger kick.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/teaninich-signatory-vintage-2008-2021-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:36 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:36 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/teaninich-signatory-vintage-2008-2021.png
Lochlea Sowing Edition (Second Crop)	Lochlea	46	56				How good is it?	The malt opens with sugar syrup, red apples and vanilla - fresh and fruity with a slight hint of citrus. This is accompanied by wine gum and a slight hint of white wine (grapes). Fitting for the transitional phase from spring to summer.	The whisky from the Lowlands opens quite young. Almond pastry (nutty notes, cereal notes and sweet) is refined with an idea of toffee. At the same time, its youth flashes through again and again - and not too scarcely. A little oak and coniferous forest can be glimpsed in the background.	Sweetish in the finish, the first release of the second season lingers for a medium length and burns slightly.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lochlea-sowing-edition-2crop-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:45 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:45 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lochlea-sowing-edition-2crop.png

Hazelburn 2006/2022 15 Year Old	Springbank	54.2	160				How good is it?	The whisky immediately unleashes a complex palette of flavours. A decent dollop of dirt and leather imparts a rustic feel that is balanced by sweet caramel fudge and sticky tobacco. Notes of red fruits, especially strawberries, mingle with a hint of dates. Dried tomatoes play along. A subtle scent of RTN chocolate is perceptible, but remains very much in the background.	In the mouth, the Hazelburn is oily and full-bodied, emphasising its maturity and quality. Notes of leather and sulphur (not too much!) add an interesting depth, while surprising sweet nuances of chilli chocolate and a handful of bacon cubes enhance the flavour experience. No - we didn't add any cola here, but we can definitely taste cola.	The finish of this 15-year-old matured Scotch is medium-long, yet intense. It is extremely spicy with dominant tobacco notes and a resurgence of sultanas. The presence of wood notes lingers.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/hazelburn-2006-2022-15-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:05 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:05 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/hazelburn-2006-2022-15.png

Islay Blended Malt Scotch Whisky Kildalton Release 2024 19 Year Old - Living Souls	Ardbeg	42	160				A whisky from Islay, a blended malt with Ardbeg roots, matured for a full 19 years - you'd expect a massive smoke bomb with a good dose of character. And that's exactly what the Kildalton Release 2024 from Living Souls delivers - but with an unexpected depth and a good pinch of surprise.	As soon as you raise the glass, you know: There's a fire here. Wisps of bacon smoke, barbecue charcoal, liquorice and espresso fill the nose. These are joined by pulled pork, honey and a hint of coniferous wood. An intense, yet harmonious flavour.	The palate continues just as powerfully: warm embers, earthy tones, honey-bacon and dark cherries. The combination of sweet smoke and red fruit is simply brilliant. This is joined by salty olives, a strong peaty note and a pleasant spiciness that rounds off the flavour. The 42% alcohol is well integrated and ensures a full-bodied, warm mouthfeel.	The finish is long and voluminous, but still pleasantly soft. Sweet oak, liquorice and a hint of tobacco linger as the smoke slowly evaporates. Not a brutal finish, but one with style - smoky, sweet and with just the right amount of spice.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/islay-blended-malt-scotch-whisky-kildalton-release-2024-19-year-old-living-souls-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/islay-blended-malt-scotch-whisky-kildalton-release-2024-19-year-old-living-souls.png
Tamdhu 18 Year Old	Tamdhu	46.8	178				How good is it?	The Tamdhu 18 Year Old opens with citrus and nutty notes, followed by classic sherry tones and a hint of prunes. An idea of rum balls and sultanas gives it a sweet depth, while the oak spice adds a robust structure. The bouquet is voluminous and massively intense.	The first sip reveals the rich fullness of this whisky. A fruity sweetness of red apple dances on the tongue, accompanied by a malty depth and a subtle sweet dryness. The usual sherry notes are present and enhanced by candied apple nuances. The texture is remarkably creamy, but a distinct kick reminds you that this is not a whisky for the faint-hearted. Dark notes of coffee, chocolate and morello cherries add a sensual complexity.	The finish is long, warming and slightly burning, carried by a fruity flavour that lingers on the tongue.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tamdhu-18-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:10 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:10 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tamdhu-18.png
Glenkinchie 12 Year Old	Glenkinchie	43	32				How good is it?	On the nose, the malt meets us with floral freshness. A malty sweetness goes hand in hand with the scent of freshly grated lemon peel. The aroma on the nose is completed by the scent of hay and mown grass.	On the palate, Glenkinchie 12 continues to present a strong, malty sweetness. This is joined by very appropriately slightly bitter spiciness. It distances itself somewhat from the lemon aroma of the nose. We continue to think of freshly mown Scottish greenery, complemented by notes of apples which were not quite finished ripening. The fresh sweet flavors do not overwhelm the palate.	Finally, the scotch finishes briefly and succinctly. With slightly bitter oak, in keeping with the previous flavor not obtrusively intense.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenkinchie-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:10 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:10 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenkinchie-12.png
Tobermory 12 Year Old Release 2017	Tobermory	46.3	85				The Tobermory Distillery may not be as well-known as the big names from Scotland, but its whiskies have a charm all of their own. The Tobermory 12 year old, released in 2017, is an exciting representative of the distillery. With its 46.3% ABV and no chill filtration, it promises an honest, natural bottling.	The nose surprises with a beautiful combination of tart notes and sweet warmth. There is a hint of spruce, as if you were walking through a Scottish coniferous forest. The whole thing is accompanied by solvent-like flavours that are not disturbing, but rather exciting. These are joined by caramel and honey, which lend a pleasant depth. If you take a closer look, you will also discover milk buns and juicy cherries - a really interesting and complex flavour.	On the palate, Tobermory 12 starts with a malty sweetness that is wonderfully accompanied by a light sherry note. Red fruits emerge, a hint of apple pie and a subtle citrus freshness that balances the whisky beautifully. Meanwhile, a gentle dryness reminiscent of forest honey prevails. The mouthfeel is pleasant, but could do with a little more power for some.	The finish is of medium length and brings with it a beautiful combination of bitter oak, cocoa and vanilla. The light cinnamon note is particularly exciting, which becomes noticeable at the end and leaves behind a warm spiciness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tobermory-12-year-old-release-2017-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:52 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:52 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tobermory-2017-12-year-old-release-2017.png
Balblair 1989 33 Year Old Espresso romano Cask 70.48 - The Scotch Malt Whisky Society	Balblair	62.3	871				When you take the Balblair in your hand, you can literally feel the history that lies dormant in this glass. Bottled by the Scotch Malt Whisky Society and with a strong alcohol content of 62.30 % after more than three decades, this Highland whisky offers an experience that you won't soon forget. But what makes this drop so special?	From the very first sniff, it is clear that a great deal of patience and craftsmanship have been at work here. A rich sweetness of forest honey and vanilla rises to the nose, followed by a hint of caramel, reminiscent of freshly made toffee. Suddenly it becomes fruity: strawberries - ripe and juicy - intermingle, accompanied by a slightly perfumed undertone. The whole is rounded off by the woody note of driftwood, which evokes memories of the rugged coastline of the Highlands.	At the first sip, the Balblair 1989 shows what it can do. Fruity-sweet flavours dominate the prelude and spread velvety-creamy in the mouth. A slight tingling sensation sets in, like the tingling of mineral water - lively and surprising. The strawberries come into play again, this time with a somewhat fresher character. It is a pleasure that develops slowly and reveals more and more nuances. This whisky needs time in the glass.	The finish is powerful and brings out the oak that the whisky has absorbed over 33 years of cask maturation. Spicy notes dominate without becoming too overpowering and a sweet finish ensures that the enjoyment does not end abruptly. The medium length of the finish leaves room for the question: another glass?	https://thewhiskyedition.com/balblair-1989-33-year-old-espresso-romano-cask-70-48-the-scotch-malt-whisky-society	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/balblair-1989-33-year-old-espresso-romano-cask-70-48-the-scotch-malt-whisky-society.png
Craigellachie 13 Year Old Bas-Armagnac Cask Finish	Craigellachie	46	47				How good is it?	The Speysider opens with lemongrass, a little honey and hay. This is joined by a colourful mix of tropical fruits, such as coconut and pineapple. The nose is rounded off by almonds, a light note of cinnamon and minimal toasted aromas.	Bitter, really bitter and tart like green apple in bitter almond sauce tastes the 13 year old single malt. A small peppery and salty portion of brown rice mixed with synthetic lemon form an exotic flavour profile. You have to like it.	The medium-long finish then convinces again with slightly fruity and citrusy aromas with a hint of oak.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/craigallachie-bas-armagnac-13-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:41 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:41 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/craigallachie-bas-armagnac-13.png
Glen Spey 2015/2023 - Sansibar	Glen Spey	60.1	79				How good is it?	The nose is light and spring-like. Vanilla, hay and floral notes dominate the picture, accompanied by lemony freshness and unripe fruit. Sounds nice at first, but somehow that certain something is missing - the flavours seem as if they haven't quite found each other yet.	Here comes the surprise: despite the 60.1%, Glen Spey is round and surprisingly accessible. Caramel provides a pleasant sweetness, while red fruits blend in discreetly. The high alcohol strength is well integrated without burning the palate - an unexpected plus point.	Here the whisky shows another interesting side: chocolate, oak, a hint of red fruit and a pleasant spiciness. The bitterness is pleasant and well integrated this time - not a disruptive tannin bomb, but a worthy finish.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-spey-2015-2023-sansibar-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:36 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:36 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-spey-2015-2023-sansibar.png
Isle Of Raasay Batch R02	Isle of Raasay	46.6	48				How good is it?	A hint of warm campfire welcomes, accompanied by subtle flavours of cherry, blackcurrant and red fruits. The sweet note of molasses and a hint of BBQ sauce dance with notes of burnt sugar and creamy creme brulee, while earthy nuances and herbal incense round off the picture. A hint of cinnamon adds a pleasant spice.	The single malt has a wonderfully creamy texture that caresses the palate. Meaty notes of ham and a gentle presence of warm campfire smoke meld harmoniously with sweet caramel, although this has perhaps lingered a little too long in the pot. Herbs and colourful pepper provide an exciting exchange of blows with refreshing notes of grapefruit and lemon.	The finish is long and full-bodied, with an elegant dance of tobacco and liquorice on the tongue. A subtle chilli spiciness tickles the palate, while a pleasant oak presence provides structure.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/isle-of-rasaay-batch-r02-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:03 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:03 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/isle-of-rasaay-batch-r02.png
Tullibardine 225	Tullibardine	43	34				How good is it?	We perceive distinct malty, cereal flavours in the nosing. Underneath are vanilla notes and something sour, reminiscent of pineapple or lemon squash. Something like clarified butter also tickles the nose.	The Highlander is buttery soft and creamy in the mouth. Flavours of pineapple and lemon tickle the taste buds, while vanilla and a slightly vinous grape form the core.	The single malt lingers on the palate for a medium length with a pleasant grapey bitterness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tullibardine-225-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:29 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:29 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tullibardine-225.png
Longmorn 40 Year Old 1975/2015 - Malts of Scotland	Longmorn	46.7	1250				Matured for 40 years, infinitely complex: the Longmorn 1975 from Malts of Scotland demands attention – and sometimes overwhelms us. A whisky that is too clever for us.	When we first smell it, we simultaneously think: 'Grandma's old woodshed in the countryside.' But how chic! There's a hint of rotten, damp wood in the air, as if someone had opened an antique chest. Behind it, heavy red fruits creep in – think of overripe plums that have been lying in the fruit bowl a little too long. A hint of beeswax makes it creamy, while slightly earthy notes (forest floor after rain?) provide grounding. Then it becomes apothecary-like: nutmeg appears like an old acquaintance, followed by an entire apothecary cabinet full of tinctures and herbs. Chalk! Yes, damn it, school chalk. And as if that weren't confusing enough, rose water also floats through – elegant but restrained, like a distinguished lady who doesn't wear too much perfume. This nose is complicated. It demands attention. It wants you to sit down and listen. We nod obediently, but only understand half of it.	The first sip makes your mouth tingle – you know, that prickly, almost electric sensation on your tongue. The spice hits you immediately: this is no gentle start, it's an explosion of flavour. But – and this is where it gets interesting – despite this intensity, everything remains incredibly well-rounded. Freshly roasted coffee makes its presence felt, followed by slightly burnt nut cake (you know, the crust that everyone wants). White peach brings a fruity freshness that we didn't expect. The whole thing is extremely delicate and multi-layered – as if someone were conducting an orchestra in which each instrument plays solo at times. The spicy oak is always present, but never dominant. It's like a good conductor: you know he's there, but he doesn't push himself into the foreground. After 40 years of barrel ageing, it would have been quite a feat not to become woody.	'It draaaaaags on like chewing gum,' we note. And it's true. This finish knows no end. Soft wood nestles on the palate, lots of oak (surprise!) spreads out, and cinnamon and nutmeg slowly, very slowly, fade away. You sit there, sip, wait, and the whisky is still there. Like that one party guest who doesn't get that everyone else has long since gone to bed. Except that we're not complaining here.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/longmorn-40-year-old-1975-2015-malts-of-scotland	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:13 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:13 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/longmorn-40-year-old-1975-2015-malts-of-scotland.png
Cameronbridge 1984/2019 34 Year Old - van Wees	Cameronbridge	54.9	176				Cameronbridge Distillery, one of Scotland's oldest grain distilleries, is renowned for its role in the history of Scotch whisky. This 34-year-old bottling from 1984, released by van Wees, demonstrates the transformative effects of decades of maturation in the Lowlands region. Be warned: This whisky challenges the senses and offers an extraordinary experience you won’t forget anytime soon.	The aroma is a conversation starter. At first, it evokes a gas station – a hint of industrial notes that catch you off guard. Beneath this layer lies a fruity core: overripe cherries, coconut, and a touch of exotic mango, nectarine, and peach. Cashew nuts and a sense of decayed wood add earthy undertones, lending complexity to the bouquet.	On the palate, this whisky is powerful and multifaceted. The 54.90% ABV makes its presence known without overwhelming. Spicy oak takes the lead, supported by deep dark red fruits in the background. Then it takes an unexpected turn: an extreme dryness reminiscent of chalk dominates the mouthfeel, while an outstandingly oily texture makes the whisky almost viscous. A hint of soapiness may polarize, but it adds an intriguing layer to the complexity.	The finish surprises with its discrepancy. While the flavors linger on the tongue, the throat remains almost untouched. Subtle notes of honey, hay, and vanilla provide a gentle softness, although the overall impression feels almost ethereal.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/cameronbridge-1984-2019-34-year-old-van-wees	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:23 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:23 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/cameronbridge-1984-2019-34-year-old-van-wees.png
Glen Moray Fired Oak 10 Year Old	Glen Moray	40	30				Is the whisky worth it?	The first impression is sweet and inviting, like a hint of candy floss. A scent of sun-ripened orange followed by a gentle embrace of vanilla and caramel spreads. A drop of coffee rounds off the flavour profile, subtle yet remarkable.	The Glen Moray reveals a powerful presence of ethanol, which quickly gives way to a rich sweet flavour. Flavours such as juicy banana chips and a pleasant malt tone take over. An oaky spiciness unfolds in the mouth, accompanied by a silky, buttery mouthfeel.	The finish is of medium length, a delicate note of liquorice chocolate remains.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-moray-fired-oak-10-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-moray-fired-oak-10.png
Campbeltown Loch Edition 2023	Springbank	46	40				How good is it?	Cold smoke and a wet towel open up your nose. Sounds worse than it is. With a little kiwi, cement and green apple, the result is a really exciting olfactory profile, as the flavours almost form a work of art in composition. Incidentally, every now and then there is a flash of an odour reminiscent of a chainsaw after pruning.	The blended malt from the Cambeltown region is oily and soft on the tongue. A very special pepper - namely Madagascar pepper (the flavour - not the spiciness) opens intensely, but clears the way relatively quickly for an almost dried-out riverbed of bittersweet coffee chocolate.	The long finish is accompanied by cold smoke, a little oak and spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/campbeltown-loch-2023	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:21 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:21 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/campbeltown-loch-2023.png
Speyburn 18 Year Old	Speyburn	46	77				How good is it?	On the nose, Speyburn 18 presents strong aromas of raisins, leather, and sugar, as well as dried plums and nutty notes. The whisky has a full-bodied and dark character, with an intense oak aroma that balances out the sweeter notes. There is also a hint of citrus and dark chocolate, giving it a slightly similar profile to Schwarzwälder Kirsch without the cream.	It is not as sweet as one might expect based on its nose. Instead, it has an intense sherry aroma and a clear oak spice that dominates the flavor profile. There are also subtle citrus notes present, which add a touch of freshness and balance out the sweetness of the sherry and the spiciness of the oak.	The finish is long and slightly bitter, with a lasting sweetness. The bitterness adds depth and complexity, while the sweetness adds a touch of balance and roundness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/speyburn-18-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:55 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:55 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/speyburn-18.png
Glenturret 1987/2018 30 Year Old Xtra Old Particular - Douglas Laing	Glenturret	45.3	350				How good is it?	Delicate and multifaceted, we smell spicy oak aromas, nutty notes and old grey bread. Behind that lies a velvety softness, something buttery and vanilla-floral characteristics.	Just as buttery as the nose, notes reminiscent of oatmeal with honey in orange juice spread out on the palate. Further back, precisely integrated spicy oak notes, some apple juice and a malty sweetness come to full effect. The individual aromas are clearly distributed and are suitably transported by alcohol.	A long-lasting finish with spicy oak, which later turns into a delightful sweetness, rounds off the pleasure in style.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenturret-30-year-old-1987-2018-xop-douglas-laing	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:57 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:57 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenturret-1987-30-douglas-laing.png
Inchgower 2010/2023 - Sansibar	Inchgower	57.6	79				How good is it?	The nose is crisp and fresh: green apple, a hint of pineapple and damp wood, as if it had just rained. There is also a fine herbal note reminiscent of herbal tea. Very green, very lively - but also without great depth. You can tell that wood had little to do here.	It starts off sweet and juicy on the tongue: apple, a light tropical note and a fine dryness. But then it suddenly comes round the corner with white pepper and provides a bit of action. It remains a young, direct flavour - not complex, but certainly entertaining.	Hardly any oak, but the sweet-fruity line continues with a tingling finish. At the very end, there is a slight bitterness that is not disturbing, but does not necessarily provide a rounded finish. You simply realise that the cask has only been working on the back burner here.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/inchgower-2010-2023-sansibar-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:49 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:49 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/inchgower-2010-2023-sansibar.png

Ardnamurchan AD 10.21:06	Ardnamurchan	46.8	49				How good is it?	A sweet and sour bouquet stings the nose intensely and is a little overwhelming. Once you have got used to these aromas, you will find a real variety of flavours underneath. A salty orange meets spicy oak, which is lightly interwoven with an iodised peat note. In between, a red baked apple in vanilla sauce flashes up.	The light peat smoke from the nose becomes more definite on the tongue, followed by a peppery (alcoholic) spiciness. The watery, voluminous mouthfeel opens sour and bitter (lemon balm, artichokes) and transitions into an herbaceous taste (baked potato spice mix). The journey ends with a fruity-sweet region and is again strongly reminiscent of red apple in vanilla sauce.	The dry, medium-long finish is slightly peaty-berry, has a bit of dark chocolate in it and is still youthfully bitter.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ardnamurchan-ad-10-21-06-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:46 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:46 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ardnamurchan-ad-10-21-06.png

Wolfburn 12 Year Old (2025)	Wolfburn	46	55				The northernmost mainland distillery of Scotland returns with a whisky that radiates both groundedness and finesse: the Wolfburn 12 Years. Matured in a combination of first-fill bourbon barrels and Oloroso sherry casks, it presents itself as a classic Highlander with a modern twist. Bottled at 46.0% ABV, non-chill filtered and natural in color, it steps into the glass without disguise. But what does this really mean in practice? Let’s take a closer look.	On the nose, the Wolfburn 12 opens like a sweet and warm landscape, almost reminiscent of a dessert buffet. Honey flows generously, supported by a fine sugary touch that recalls a patisserie in full swing. Alongside comes the refined freshness of Nashi pear – light, elegant, almost aristocratic – while deeper tones of plum jam add warmth and comfort. Toffee and creamy caramel appear as well, evoking liquidized childhood treats, almost like someone distilled Toffifee straight into the glass. The impression is charming and inviting without being overbearing.	On the palate, this elegance continues but with a slight twist. The fruitiness recedes somewhat, making way for a more grainy and malty character. It feels honest and robust, a reminder that whisky is always, at its core, a story of water, malt, and wood. Alongside this comes a broad layer of vanilla, creamy and unmistakably a gift from the bourbon casks. Once again, the Toffifee impression emerges: milk chocolate, caramel, hazelnut – a trio that never gets old. The texture is creamy, full-bodied, and well-rounded, leaving no sharp edges. This is not a whisky that aims to shock; it is more of a gentleman in the glass, extending a warm handshake instead of a fist.	The finish brings the sherry quietly onto the stage. Not a dramatic entrance, but a subtle aside, adding spice and a touch of oak bitterness to structure the finale. The length is medium – neither fleeting nor endless – just long enough to leave an impression without overstaying its welcome. There’s also a maritime nuance that surprises in the background, a faint sea breeze drifting through as a final reminder that Thurso lies not far from the ocean.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/wolfburn-12-year-old-2025-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:21 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:21 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/wolfburn-12-year-old-2025.png
Glendronach Cask Strength Batch 12	Glendronach	58.2	85				How our perception of sherry has changed over the years. Toffifee moments included!	Today, from today's perspective, this Glendronach seems almost 'mild' - although objectively speaking it is still intense enough to take a beginner's breath away. From the very first nosing, it is clear that the sherry cask speaks for itself. Sherry clearly dominates the nose, accompanied by candied oranges that smell like Christmas market memories. Cinnamon joins in - not intrusive, but like a warm coat on a cold Highland day. Walnut and black pepper provide the necessary complexity, while liquorice adds an interesting dark note. This is classic Glendronach as you know and love it. But if you smell it today and think of the extreme first-fill maturations that are now standard, you'll understand what I mean: This is a nice sherry bomb, but one from a time when subtlety was still part of the game	This Glendronach is very sherry forward, no question. But do you know what surprised me the most? The toffee moment. Yes, you read that right: Nut, chocolate and caramel merge here to create a flavour experience that immediately reminds me of those golden sweets. Black pepper returns and shows that despite all the sweetness, there is still bite. Light strawberry flits by - almost shyly, as if it didn't dare to join in with all the dark fruitiness. Dried plums dominate the 'dried fruit fuss', as I affectionately call it - those concentrated, sweet flavours that are typical of good sherry maturation. The whole thing is slightly dry and pleasantly spicy. It's like an old friend telling you a story: familiar, warm, but still interesting enough to listen to.	The medium-long finish shows why Glendronach has had such a good reputation for decades. It finishes dry, with dark chocolate that is elegant rather than bitter. Slightly bitter oak mingles with it. Sultanas round off the finish.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glendronach-cask-strength-batch-12-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:36 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:36 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glendronach-cask-strength-batch-12.png
Tomintoul 16 Year Old	Tomintoul	40	65				How good is it?	Well-ordered, orange, hazelnut and dried fruit are found as base aromas. In the background, malty-grainy and slightly floral (daisies?) notes are distributed. We also find some bitter orange, honey and oats, which are infused and character-building.	The goal is quite clear. This whisky from the Speyside wants to be soft and velvety. Buttercrossaint and toasted sesame, as well as light citrus notes we find alongside a little toasted oak, marzipan (almonds) and walnut nuttiness. A little white pepper here and there, and that's it.	This malt finishes medium-bodied, clean and warming, with almond, oat and oak tones.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tomintoul-16-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tomintoul-16.png
Ardnamurchan AD:02.22 Peated Cask Strength	Ardnamurchan	58.2	69				How good is it?	The first impression is very sweet for a peated malt. We detect vanilla, citrus and a slight hint of oats. There is also a subtle hint of honey. Surrounded by cold fire smoke, we also find nutty flavours and some dried tobacco leaves. When the nose is allowed to breathe a little, the scent of ripe bananas emerges.	The great complexity of the nose continues. A blend of sugar syrup, lemon peel and vanilla. Wonderfully balanced and subtle, the sweetness is bound up in the smoke of a smouldering campfire. The very pleasant oiliness coats the tongue and palate with a slight dryness.	The single malt's finish is long and intense. A peppery oak note rounds off the AD.02:22 experience.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ardnamurchan-ad-02-22-peated-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:39 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:39 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ardnamurchan-ad-02-22-peated.png
Glentauchers 11 Year Old 2012/2024 - Signatory Vintage	Glentauchers	57.1	49				How good is it?	The nose is immediately malty and caramel-sweet. We find vanilla and fresh shortbread before the scent unfolds into fruity notes. Yellow raisins, apricot, mango, and a hint of dark forest berries. Surrounded by perfumed floral notes, we think of forest honey and get a very lively impression of the malt.	On the palate, this Glentauchers hits with full force. Oily, almost syrupy, we get a load of fruity intensity. Cherries and grainy sweetness are accompanied by toffee. Here too, there is a quick transformation, and the spicy-nutty aromas dominate. We find cloves, a good dose of oak spice, and a small cup of café au lait.	he finish is long-lasting, warming, and full-bodied. We have a combination of baking cocoa and oak wood, accompanied by ripe mango and some herbal notes, where we most associate with licorice.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glentauchers-11-year-old-100-proof-signatory-vintage	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:58 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:58 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glentauchers-11-signatory-vintage-100proof.png
Ruadh Maor 2011/2024 Jack the Ripper - Malts of Scotland	Glenturret	55.6	111				Anyone expecting a gentle drop from a Highland whisky such as the Ruadh Maor 2011/2024 Jack the Ripper from Malts of Scotland is in for a surprise. With an intensely smoky profile, this independent bottler from the Glenturret distillery brings a real heavyweight to the glass.	The Ruadh Maor reveals its complexity from the very first sniff. Dark fruits such as ripe plums and a hint of blackberries mingle with an intense smoke that is strongly reminiscent of Islay whiskies. The iodised, almost medicinal notes are also striking - an impression of plaster and camomile pervades the aroma. A green apple brings a subtle freshness, while warm, woody notes of sandalwood emphasise the depth.	The first sip is a powerful prelude: Spicy oak notes meet sweet liquorice and the dark fruits from the nose. The smoke remains present, accompanied by a maritime saltiness that reinforces the Islay feeling. A hint of forest honey provides an unexpected, pleasant sweetness and perfectly balances the spicy intensity.	In the finish, the whisky remains maritime and spicy, but without being too overpowering. The saltiness gives it a refreshing finish, while the smoke lingers for a short time. The finish is of medium length and leaves a balanced memory of wood, smoke and sea breeze.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ruadh-maor-2011-2024-jack-the-ripper-malts-of-scotland-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:11 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ruadh-maor-2011-2024-jack-the-ripper-malts-of-scotland.png
Isle of Raasay Core Batch R0.01	Isle of Raasay	46.4	55				How good is it?	The nose begins with sweet wood smoke, accompanied by notes of cherries, oranges, apricots and a hint of vanilla. A slight BBQ note gives it a rustic yet inviting nuance. Over time, more citrus notes, especially orange, develop and give the bouquet a refreshing flavour.	The flavour of this core bottling is a feast for the senses. It is reminiscent of the feeling of Talisker in the cinema when the film is over. Sweet wood smoke and a slight maritime saltiness dominate, accompanied by sweet popcorn, salted caramel and an abundance of dark berries and chocolate. The fruit notes from the nose are subtle yet present in the flavour. Despite its young age, this whisky is surprisingly smooth and not sharp.	The finish is of medium length and ends with a sweet smokiness and a light fruity note.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/isle-of-raasay-batch-r0-01-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:05 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:05 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/isle-of-raasay-r011.png
Glenlivet Distiller's Reserve	Glenlivet	40	35				How good is it?	On the nose, the Single Malt initially appears somewhat acidic. Overall, the aroma is very light with hints of green apple and vanilla. Behind that, we find subtle malt sweetness, a faint wine or sherry note, and something exotic that we would describe as rosewater.	The taste on the palate is clearly dominated by citrus fruits. Orange peel and grapefruit mingle with subtle vanilla and a noticeable oakiness. The underlying hint of sherry is also present but somewhat subdued behind the fruity notes.	The finish is short and rather subtle. We once again perceive hints of rose. Alongside that, there's a lingering oakiness on the tongue, accompanied by a touch of white pepper.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenlivet-distillers-reserve	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:06 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:06 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenlivet-distillers-reserve.png
Glenlivet 13 Year Old 1st Fill American Oak	Glenlivet	40	40				What can the Easy Sipper deliver?	On the first nosing, the classic Speyside character immediately shines through: light sawdust and sweet strawberries with cream and sugar evoke bright, fruity aromas. A subtle floral soap note adds complexity, complemented by hints of toast, pomelo, and lemon sherbet. The bouquet feels inviting and harmonious, with a sweet undertone that’s pleasant but not overly complex.	The first sip confirms its approachable nature. Creamy and smooth, it glides over the palate, delivering notes of vanilla, almond, and white chocolate reminiscent of cocoa butter. The juicy sweetness of honeydew melon adds a fresh, light dimension. This whisky clearly benefits from the influence of American oak, known for imparting mild and sweet flavors.	The finish is buttery smooth but relatively short. Subtle hints of orange and a touch of oak create a pleasant conclusion. It’s a whisky that quietly exits the stage, leaving a gentle impression.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenlivet-2021-13-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:39 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:39 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenlivet-13-year-old-1st-fill-american-oak.png
Springbank 15 Year Old	Springbank	46	130				How good is it?	Upon nosing, robust fruity notes greet us immediately. We encounter a generous portion of sherry accompanied by dark chocolate, roasted dates, and a hint of caramel. In the background, there's a subtle citrus note. The velvety aroma is rounded off by light smoke and some maritime notes.	On the palate, this Springbank is also very robust. Strong spice and pleasant oak underpin a bouquet of nuts and dried fruits. Allowing it some time in the mouth reveals leathery flavors, raisins, figs, and a touch of earthiness.	The Single Malt continues its expected trajectory in the finish as well. Robust, powerful, spicy, and very long. We discover great malty sweetness and the lingering aromas of oak, leather, and sherry.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/springbank-15-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:19 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:19 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/springbank-15.png
Fettercairn Warehouse 2 Batch 003	Fettercairn	50.6	75				How good is it?	A tantalising mix of honey, flowers and fresh grass rises from the glass. There is also an extra portion of tropical fruits such as mango, pineapple and strawberries, accompanied by a hint of citrus acidity.	On the palate, the Fettercairn reveals a lively interplay of spicy ginger, refreshing lemongrass and a hint of white pepper that tingles on the tongue and leaves a pleasant tingling sensation. The malty sweetness is complemented by the appearance of juicy sultanas, while a slightly oily texture gives the mouthfeel a pleasant fullness without being too dry.	Although the finish is rather short and weak, it offers a subtle blend of gentle oak and subtle spice that harmonises with a hint of dark chocolate.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/fettercairn-warehouse-2-batch-3-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:08 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:08 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/fettercairn-warehouse-2-batch-3.png
Knockando 12 Year Old	Knockando	43	35				How good is it?	As we would expect from a Speysider: nutty and fruity. We think of apple, pear and honey. A floral scent rounds off the bright, light fragrance.	Tastes like cinema. A very cereal aroma inevitably makes us think of popcorn and canned corn. Some vanilla and oak sneak up behind. This scotch is very delicate.	In the medium-long finish, the single malt becomes a tad bitter, but remains nutty and malty.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/knockando-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:00 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:00 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/knockando-12.png
Laphroaig Brodir Final Batch	Laphroaig	48	97				How good is it?	The Laphroaig Brodir Final Batch has a complex and layered aroma, with Laphroaig's characteristic phenolic and smoky notes present from the first moment. There is also a slight saltiness, followed by fruit and citrus notes, as well as hints of plums and custard. The aroma is also spicy, with hints of churros and cinnamon sugar.	On the palate, the single malt is bold and full-bodied, with dominant seaweed and iodine notes and a seabed feel. Added to this are flavours of dark fruits, including intense plums and berries, as well as a pleasant and rich smoke. The profile is also rounded off by a spicy honey sweetness.	The finish of the Brodir is expectedly long and smoky, with a lingering fruity sweetness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/laphroaig-brodir-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:49 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:49 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/laphroaig-brodir.png
Glenrothes 12 Year Old Oloroso Finish - Darkness!	Glenrothes	56.6	105				How good is it?	On the nose, the single malt reveals a tantalising bouquet reminiscent of Mon Cherie, with ripe cherries and dark chocolate. The opening is complemented by fresh strawberries, juicy blackberries and a subtle nuttiness, which is supported by a malty base.	The palate reveals a palette of flavours that pamper the palate. Juicy figs and pickled sultanas bring a sweet fullness, while a gentle bitterness balances the sweetness. Aromas of orange peel and cinnamon lend a pleasant spiciness, while a hint of sour bitterness gives the flavour the necessary depth.	The finish is long-lasting and intense, with a dominant presence of coffee and dark chocolate. Traces of dates or sultanas combined with a strong oak presence linger for a long time.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/darkness-glenrothes-12-oloroso-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:10 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:10 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/darkness-glenrothes-12-oloroso.png
Glenfarclas 15 Year Old	Glenfarclas	46	62				How good is it?	On the nose, the Glenfarclas 15 year old shows a slightly dry note, which is complemented by a tart freshness. Green apples are prominent, accompanied by a sweet honey note and a hint of cream that smooths the flavour. Cinnamon spice and almonds add another dimension, while an exotic kumquat note gives the bouquet an interesting depth.	On the tongue, the single malt is mildly fruity at the top and provides a tingling sensation that invigorates the taste buds. The whisky is full-bodied and develops a spicy intensity that is complemented by the flavour of roasted honey dates and toasted oak. Notes of old wood give it a deep, earthy complexity that rounds off the overall picture.	The finish is warming and dry, leaving a pleasant aftertaste of walnut and spicy flavours. A hint of coloured pepper and coffee beans provides additional depth and makes the finish particularly long and complex.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenfarclas-15-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:53 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:53 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenfarclas-15.png
Macduff 20 Year Old - The Observatory	Macduff	40	35				How good is it?	A very sweet and vanilla note greets the nose. Later, lemon curd and spicy oak follow in the background. Surprisingly, we also perceive a sharp ethanol note. Slightly sour aromas support the composition, which is reminiscent of a sponge cake roll.	Foam sugar and marshmallows dominate the taste. Rounded off by a present oaky component, the Single Grain is very delicate. The whole thing is sweetened by a fair amount of forest honey.	The medium-long finish is vanilla, spicy and slightly bitter.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/the-observatory-20-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:54 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:54 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/the-observatory.png
Caol Ila 9 Year Old 2015/2024 - James Eadie	Caol Ila	54.9	87				How good is it?	The flavour is reminiscent of bacon glazed in honey - sweet, salty, a hint of smoke. Lemon zest and bourbon vanilla give it a fresh, creamy note that harmonises perfectly with the icing sugar sweetness. But then come the maritime notes: Rust, seaweed, and a hint of sea salt. It's like walking over the cliffs on a rough Islay day.	At the first sip, an intense rush of iodine and cold smoke is noticeable, accompanied by a strong salty impact that emphasises the maritime tones. But then the whisky surprises: a warm, almost jam-like sweetness of redcurrant jelly comes to the fore, reminiscent of a cosy evening by the fire. The slightly burnt note is interesting, adding depth and complexity without losing balance.	The finish is long, voluminously smoky and accompanied by a distinct saltiness that is like a gentle sea breeze. The earthy notes - almost granite-like - give it weight, while the red-fruity sweetness provides an unexpectedly pleasant contrast.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/caol-ila-9-year-old-2015-2024-james-eadie	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:28 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:28 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/caol-ila-9-2015-2024-james-eadie.png
Ardbeg 2017/2025 7 Year Old Bohemian Schnapsidee - VAME Malts	Ardbeg	57.1	75				Ardbeg with Irn-Bru finish? Can that work?	You open the bottle - and it's immediately clear: this isn't a toy. Or is it? The first wave is like an old gym changing room where someone has just opened an energy drink. There's tar, campfire smoke, orange, but also something synthetic, sweet and shrill. Gummy bears dance between BBQ sauce and vanilla malt.	What hits the tongue here is voluminous, sweet, smoky and somehow completely out of control. Imagine a mango BBQ sauce into which a tub of Swedish cardamom buns has fallen - and then someone has thrown liquorice and orange on top. Sounds confusing? It is.	The finish wants it all - immediately and simultaneously. First sweet and orangey, then suddenly salty, earthy, tarry - and then back to BBQ, fruit, smoke, a hint of gym and a final sip of gummy bear juice. Yes, it's almost artificial, but in a deliberately charming way.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ardbeg-2017-2025-7-year-old-bohemian-schnapsidee-vame-malts-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:50 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ardbeg-2017-2025-7-year-old-bohemian-schnapsidee-vame-malts.png
Wolfburn 10 Year Old (2023 Release)	Wolfburn	46	42				Solid - but is that enough?	The aroma is multi-layered, but never overloaded: burnt toast, honey, daisies - a mixture of light-coloured fruits such as apple and pear, interspersed with cinnamon, leather and a hint of dark chocolate. It is not a wild ride, but rather a slow, calm unfolding. The flavours stand side by side without drowning each other out.	What the nose hints at becomes reality on the tongue: milk chocolate, sultanas, a little date and burnt caramel. The dram has a dark character without being heavy. It is creamy, round and scores with hints of nutmeg and - very subtle - strawberry in the background.	The finish is rather short, but harmonious: sweet coffee, coffee grounds, a little bitter, but pleasantly woody. A fine sherry note shimmers through, never dominant, more like a greeting from afar. No drama, no fireworks.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/wolfburn-10-year-old-2023-release	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:44 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:44 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/wolfburn-10-year-old-2023-release.png
Glen Moray 15 Year Old	Glen Moray	40	32				How good is it?	Right from the first whiff, a powerful and harmonious aroma unfolds. The nose detects a caramel note beautifully accompanied by spicy oak, delicate wine notes, and sweet sherry fruits. It evokes memories of chocolate-covered raisins and a delicious bar of milk chocolate.	On the palate, flavors of chocolate and raisins immediately come to life, accompanied by toasty notes and a delightful, spicy-salty fullness. The intense oak, considering its 15-year age, is surprisingly present without leaving any bitterness. A hint of dryness on the palate rounds off the tasting experience. Overall, the whisky on the palate presents itself as less fruity than the nose suggested, revealing maltiness, hints of baking cocoa, and a touch of overripe mango.	The finish, especially for a non-peated whisky, proves to be long. It leaves a wonderful spiciness with a harmonious blend of chocolate, oak, and malt, accompanied by a subtle tingle.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-moray-15-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:34 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:34 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-moray-15.png
Benrinnes 21 Year Old Grand Crescendo - Diageo Special Releases 2024	Benrinnes	55.4	381				Once again, the new Diageo Special Releases are here – this time under the name Grand Crescendo. As always, expectations are high, especially given the hefty price tag that accompanies these limited editions year after year. This time, the spotlight is on a 21-year-old Benrinnes from Speyside – a distillery cherished by insiders but rarely highlighted in such a prominent way. A good reason to take a closer look at this single malt.	The aromas are powerful from the start. A vibrant fruit basket emerges with distinct notes of peach, mango, and berries – exotic, sweet, and inviting. Marzipan and a hint of caramel add depth, while tobacco leaves introduce a spicy edge. Despite the 55.4% ABV, everything is well integrated and aromatically precise.	As expected: full-bodied and intense. The initial impression is bold, almost explosive – a true flavor journey. Sweet fruit pairs with elegant yet noticeable oak spice. A tangy orange note adds freshness, complemented by hints of strawberry and a nutty element reminiscent of hazelnut. A slight dryness rounds out the mouthfeel.	The finish is long, robust, and notably astringent. Menthol brings a cooling freshness, while strong oak notes and leather add structure. Walnuts leave a slightly bitter, nutty final note. A finish that lingers – and challenges.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/benrinnes-2024-21-year-old-grand-crescendo-diageo-special-releases-2024-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:03 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:03 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/benrinnes-2024-21-year-old-grand-crescendo-diageo-special-releases-2024.png
Tullibardine 8 Year Old 2015/2023 - Signatory Vintage	Tullibardine	57.1	45				How good is it?	This single malt whisky from the Scottish Highlands opens with an earthy, crisp flavour, like a real sherry. The typical profile is played out here: Dark, red fruits, cereal maltiness, dark chocolate and a dash of oak spice. Very classic, very intense - the cask has really delivered here. However, the secondary notes of root vegetables such as beetroot and carrots are exciting.	The colour already shows what is to come. The flavour of the Tullibardine 8 year old is also really progressive. We taste dark fruits and a handful of blackberries in an equally earthy, powerful and full-bodied, oily flavour. We also encounter the maltiness from the nosing again here. The fruity-fresh distillery character comes through in some places, but is kept very small by the cask.	The Highlander has a slightly salty, yet fruity finish over a long period of time.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tullibardine-8-year-old-100-proof-signatory-vintage	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:30 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:30 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tullibardine-8-signatory-vintage.png
Lagavulin 8 Years Old	Lagavulin	48	48				How good is it?	We are greeted by a true chasm of smoke. A cold campfire is enveloped by charcoal and a slight medicinal touch. Overall, we find a cold smoke profile with hints of seaweed and seawater. You have to get through this wall first. But with enough time, the typical bourbon cask aromas develop. Primarily citrus – joined by grainy notes of oats and a hint of vanilla. Subtle tones of oak and mandarins round out the nose.	On the palate, the malt unfolds its cold smoke. It develops a creamy mouthfeel with an intriguing note reminiscent of pan-fried mushrooms. There’s also a wonderful maritime quality of seaweed, seawater, and a certain mineral component. The palate then becomes nutty. We find burnt hazelnuts and a hint of roasted almonds.	The finish is long and carried by the smoke, which surprisingly becomes somewhat warming here. We still have the maritime aroma of sea salt, now accompanied by oak, the citrus note we had on the nose, and a slightly earthy sheath.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lagavulin-8-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:00 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:00 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lagavulin-8.png
Glenfiddich Reserve Cask	Glenfiddich	40	34				How good is it?	The nosing starts pleasantly, if unsurprisingly. Vanilla is the first note that comes to the nose - sweet, almost creamy. The sherry cask is also noticeable, but rather discreetly, without the depth and complexity that we know from whiskies aged more heavily in sherry. A hint of spicy oak provides a slightly bitter contrast, but this quickly disappears again. Another interesting nuance is provided by the wet leather, which lends the bouquet a certain earthiness.	The flavour of the Glenfiddich Reserve Cask remains true to its line. The first impression is buttery smooth, which gives it a pleasant drinkability. This is the kind of whisky that can be enjoyed without much thought, perhaps at a social gathering or as an accompaniment to a conversation. The oak comes more to the fore and gives the whisky a little more substance, but here too everything remains within reason. There are no overpowering or polarising flavours - making it ideal for those looking for an uncomplicated pleasure.	The finish, like the rest of the whisky, is sweet and fruity and rather short. The oak gently accompanies the finish without remaining present for a particularly long time. Anyone expecting a long, intense finish will probably be disappointed here, but for a whisky that is clearly designed as a mass product, it remains pleasant and pleasing.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenfiddich-reserve-cask-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:25 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:25 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenfiddich-reserve-cask.png
Tomintoul 14 Year Old	Tomintoul	46	57				How good is it?	The first impression of the Tomintoul 14 Year Old is dense and complex. The nose is enveloped by a subtle smoke that remains pleasantly subtle and does not play the dominant role that one might expect from more heavily peated whiskies. In the foreground are honey notes that provide a pleasant sweetness, accompanied by a hay and vanilla flavour that is typical of Speyside whiskies. Floral notes give the flavour a slight freshness, while the smoke in the background adds a certain depth. An interesting comparison here could be Clynelish, which also has smoky tones, but is much ‘funkier’. The Tomintoul remains more elegant and accessible.	On the tongue, the Tomintoul 14 year old shows its malty side, with the honey flavour still present and given an additional dimension by the light smoke. The whisky has a heavy, spicy texture, which is in contrast to many fruity, light Speyside whiskies. Interesting notes of apricot brandy and a potato spice mix bring an unexpected spiciness that is rounded off with a hint of mint.	The finish of the single malt is of medium length and remains predominantly spicy and oaky. A slight sweetness of sugar mixes with a sour note, which gives the whisky an interesting finish. This acidity ensures that the whisky does not remain too heavy on the tongue and has a pleasant finish.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tomintoul-14-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:40 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:40 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tomintoul-14.png
anCnoc 12 Year Old	Knockdhu	40	27				How good is it?	The nose is pleasantly malty with a good dose of grain. There are also fruity notes of banana and pear, rounded off by a fine vanilla. Behind this is we find some cinnamon spice.	The malt is full-bodied and pleasantly oily. The intense malt aroma lingers. We also think of dried banana chips. A beautifully integrated oak combines with nutty almond notes. On the palate we taste cinnamon and a slightly tangy acidity.	The finish is medium long and fruity. The pleasant oak on the palate develops into a discreet spiciness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/an-cnoc-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:38 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:38 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/an-cnoc-12.png
Tormore 2011 12 Year Old Spiced vanilla chai cake Cask 105.45 - The Scotch Malt Whisky Society	Tormore	66.8	90				The Scotch Malt Whisky Society (SMWS) is known for its unusual and often experimental bottlings. With the Tormore 2011, matured for 12 years and a proud 66.8% ABV, the SMWS has ventured into a powerful yet playful bourbon cask experience. The sonorous name ‘Spiced Vanilla Chai Cake’ raises expectations of a sweet, spicy and deeply layered world of flavours.	A lot is happening here. A mixture of juicy apple and ripe pear meets an unexpected, almost maritime freshness. The whole is accompanied by a perfumed note reminiscent of time-honoured wood polish or even a noble sandalwood scent. This is joined by caramel, a hint of chalk dust and a subtle stony sweetness. If you take your time, you will discover ever new facets - a multi-layered bouquet that balances between sweet and mineral.	Expecting a certain heaviness on the nose, the whisky is surprisingly light-footed and sweet. An intense sugariness spreads across the tongue, almost as if someone had placed a spoonful of caramelised malt sugar on the taste buds. This is accompanied by light-coloured fruit, a subtle maltiness and an unusual spiciness - a little like a rustic rye whisky, but with more elegance. Interestingly, the sweetness is reminiscent of those dark, brown vodkas that fascinate with their syrupy texture.	This is where the Tormore shows its edgier side. The finish is rather short, but brings with it a salty breeze - a final nod to the maritime notes from the nosing. Spicy accents, a hint of oak and a gentle peppery tingle finish pleasantly.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tormore-2011-12-year-old-spiced-vanilla-chai-cake-cask-105-45-the-scotch-malt-whisky-society	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tormore-2011-12-year-old-spiced-vanilla-chai-cake-cask-105-45-the-scotch-malt-whisky-society.png
Laphroaig Cairdeas 2024 Cask Favourites 10 Year Old	Laphroaig	52.4	95				Is the limited edition Fèis Ìle bottling worth it?	The opening is unmistakable: the iodine-rich, medicinal Laphroaig smoke, accompanied by a hint of tobacco. Milder aromas of charred grill grate join in. Behind the peat, we find the sherry casks: plums wrapped in bacon, old leather, orange peel, and the scents of fermented grapes. In the top notes, we detect orange peel and a touch of forest honey.	On the palate, pure maritime aromas unfold immediately. We think of seaweed and seawater. The malt is creamy and effervescent with hints of chili and ginger. On the palate, it is herbaceous and dry with hints of burnt sage. In the background, light notes of orange peel, licorice, and coffee grounds emerge.	The finish is medium-long and comes with a good dose of slightly bitter oak. A light pepper kick with voluminous smoke is accompanied by a smoldering leaf fire. The dram is rounded off by hints of burnt caramel.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/laphroaig-cairdeas-2024-cask-favourites-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:59 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:59 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/laphroaig-cairdeas-2024.png
Glenfiddich Select Cask	Glenfiddich	40	34				How good is it?	The aroma of this whisky is quite restrained at first, almost closed. Some citrus tickles the nose and brings freshness to the slightly dull, restrained structure. Delicate vanilla and a hint of hay unfold underneath, accompanied by a hint of metallic and herbal notes. Overall, the Glenfiddich Select Cask is balanced and pleasant, but remains rather restrained and quiet in its flavour - a fragrance that promises a lot, but does not yet fully reveal itself.	On the palate, the Glenfiddich Select Cask is as smooth as butter. The velvety texture dominates the flavour here, and the whisky actually glides down the tongue without any sharpness or distracting edges. The vanilla flavour blends subtly with light oak and there is a hint of malt. But while the mouthfeel is pleasant, there are no real highlights. The flavour, like the aroma, remains rather pale and restrained, with little depth and hardly any surprising moments.	The finish of the Glenfiddich Select Cask is short and inconspicuous. A brief hint of oak spice flickers up, but before you know it, the last notes evaporate. What remains is an overall impression that is not very lasting, which emphasises the gentle character of the whisky, but unfortunately leaves hardly any reverberation.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glenfiddich-select-cask-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:26 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:26 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glenfiddich-select-cask.png
Bunnahabhain 12 Year Old	Bunnahabhain	46.3	39				Is the Islay whisky any good?	The single malt has very pleasant flavours. We smell a varied palette of fruits, such as Nashi pears and apricots, nectarines, quinces and mirabelle plums. This is followed by sweet brown sugar with a fine sherry fruit note. We think of plums and dates. The nose is rounded off with some oak and a hint of liquorice.	In the tasting, the somewhat more bitter flavours come to the fore. Baking cocoa, oat flakes and a good portion of oak open up. Vanilla, black tea, pear and something pleasantly sour - perhaps green apple - are found in the middle section. Later, the malt opens up further and brings orange peel and some cinnamon. Round, creamy and soft.	Pleasant and maritime, the whisky from the island of Islay remains long-lasting, warming and slightly peppery.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/bunnahabhain-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:22 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:22 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/bunnahabhain-12.png
Lochlea Harvest Edition (First Crop)	Lochlea	46	48				How good is it?	The Harvest Edition opens with apple juice. Damn apple juice. Aromas of fresh pear, maple syrup, malty sweetness and some grain and hay in the background unfold. Maybe a little nutty and kind of like a horse stable. Candy strawberries and red wine notes are also in the mix.	Also: apple juice. This is followed by fresh, sugared strawberries on milk chocolate. Underneath, a few dry grasses, nutty notes and a pile of a mixture of butter biscuits and oat biscuits.	The finish is very strong vinous and distinctly oaky spicy.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lochlea-harvest-edition-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:08 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:08 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lochlea-harvest-edition.png
Ardbeg Corryvreckan	Ardbeg	57.1	67				How good is it?	Very powerful, we have a fir tree-like, spicy savoury scent in our nose at the first sniff. Discreet and not very intrusive, the typical Ardbeg smoke is in the background. After a while in the glass, the perceived aromas change to butter heated in the microwave, a dark, berry fruitiness and some forest honey. With a little water: the sweetish aromas take over. Clearly more vanilla and honey, but also more charcoal and smoked ham. Some sauerkraut in the background.	A fruity oil-grease-butter-flavour with sea salt and black pepper lies broadly on the tongue. Butter caramel, ash and campfire float above. At the top are citrus aromas, maybe some bergamot. With a little water: Clearly oilier and with more citrus, but still very sweet, we taste red gummy bears, blueberries and other dark fruits. In the background, clear roasted aromas and a little nut.	Deep and powerful, the exceedingly intense Ardbeg remains salty on the palate with a slight peppery spiciness. A certain tarry note resonates. With a little water: More smoke and ash.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/ardbeg-corryvreckan-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/ardbeg-corryvreckan.png
Longrow Peated (2021)	Springbank	46	48				How good is it?	At first sniff, the nose is enveloped by a wealth of flavours. An earthy and peaty aroma wafts across, like a hint of a campfire on the beach. This is joined by mineral nuances that lend depth to the bouquet. Light phenolic notes dance with a hint of salt, accompanied by subtle hints of seaweed and kelp. A sweet note of vanilla sugar and a hint of pineapple provide a pleasant sweetness, while a light floral note resonates in the background.	The flavour of Longrow Peated reveals a harmonious combination of smoky and sweet notes. The strong peat smoke is present, but well balanced by a pleasant sweetness of sugar and honey. Surprising textures of chalk and aseptic paper add an interesting complexity to the flavour, while fruity elements of peach and salty hints of seaweed round off the profile.	The finish is long-lasting and impressive. A maritime saltiness lingers, paired with a hint of oak and an intense smoke that caresses the palate.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/longrow-peated-2021-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:13 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:13 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/longrow-peated-2021.png
Talisker 10 Year Old	Talisker	45.8	33				How good is it?	What do you expect with the rugged coastline of the Isle of Sky? Exactly - salt, seawater, rough seas. The sea air is accompanied by light cold smoke and iodine. Pleasant citrus aromas and an underlying fruitiness - we're thinking pear - round off the profile of this classic.	'It's kind of everything,' says Marcel. There is no lack of different impressions in the taste. There are malty-sweet and vanilla aromas, as well as salty and peppery-sharp moments. We also recognise the pear from the nose. Leathery hints and accompanying peat smoke are also present.	Spicy, peppery and with a tart saltiness, the 10-year-old Scotch does not burn unpleasantly on the palate. We think here of the fiery burn of a chilli.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/talisker-10-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:08 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:08 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/talisker-10.png
Mannochmore Port Finish - Murray McDavid	Mannochmore	44.5	30				How good is it?	A sweet, tantalising composition unfolds as you sniff. The scent of vanilla sugar and candy floss dominates the first nose and brings back memories of fairground treats. This sweet base is accompanied by creamy notes reminiscent of banana milkshake and pineapple. These are joined by nuances of panna cotta and fruity blueberries in buttermilk. The flavour is rounded off with sultanas.	The Mannochmore reveals a relatively simple range of flavours. The sweetness of the refined sugar harmonises with the fruity aromas of wild berries and sultanas. A slight bitterness of baking cocoa complements this fruity sweetness. The spicy notes of liquorice and a warming, creamy mouthfeel provide some balance.	The finish of the Mannochmore Port Finish is medium-long and spicy, with white pepper dominating. A certain youthfulness of the whisky remains noticeable, which is reinforced by a slight oaky bitterness. The dry, spicy notes persist.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/mannochmore-port-finish-murray-mcdavid-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:00 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:00 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/mannochmore-port-finish-murray-mcdavid.png
Deanston 2012/2023 11 Year Old - Best Dram	Deanston	55.7	75				Rum finishes are like the bell bottoms of the whisky world - sometimes totally trendy, sometimes highly controversial. In 2024, they are definitely in the spotlight, and the Deanston 2012/2023 11 Year Old from Best Dram shows why. This independent bottler has once again managed to deliver an affordable bottle that will delight novices and connoisseurs alike. But beware: rum finishes are a bit like blind dates - they can be sweet and exciting or just plain meh. This one? Clearly a fruit bomb with a wow effect.	From the very first sniff, Deanston catapults your nose into a tropical fruit basket. Imagine opening a fresh tin of peaches and apricots, sprinkling a few pieces of pineapple on top and topping it all off with honey sweetness and a hint of whipped cream. A gentle touch of creamy caramel and a small herbal greeting à la mate tea round off the experience. Sounds fancy? It is - but without being lifted off.	This is where it gets really exciting! The Deanston packs quite a punch at 55.7 % vol. but without overwhelming the palate. The oily texture is like silk on the tongue, while lemon balm and heather add fresh accents. The tropical fruits from the nose are also present here - apricot, pineapple and the like make an appearance. At the same time, a good portion of oak provides spice and depth. It is a balance of power and elegance that is simply fun.	The finish is like the final act of a good film: warm, dry and a little pensive. The oak comes to the fore and brings spicy, almost tart notes, while the fruitiness slowly fades away. A hint of tea lingers - a subtle finish that immediately invites you to take the next sip.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/deanston-2012-2023-11-year-old-best-dram	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:17 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/deanston-2012-2023-11-year-old-best-dram.png
Glen Moray 2015/2023 - Sansibar	Glen Moray	62	75				Wie gut ist der Glen Moray 2015/2023 von Sansibar? – Tasting, Bewertung und Preis im Überblick	The nose gives hope at first. Stone fruit, pear, grape - sounds good! The fruitiness is accompanied by honey and a hint of vanilla, while a grassy freshness adds a touch of vibrancy. Everything seems quite harmonious, even if not particularly deep.	Tingly, spicy and unbalanced - the 62% are not exactly elegantly integrated. Yes, there is a slight fruitiness, but it is mercilessly drowned out. Instead, there's a chaotic mixture of sharpness and bitterness. A real whipping boy of a whisky.	After the wild ride... nothing good remains. Old barrel? Mineral? Almost metallic? No matter what has happened here - it doesn't fit together. The bitter-woody finish leaves no lasting impression, except that you wonder why this whisky had to be bottled.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-moray-2015-2023-sansibar-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:48 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:48 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-moray-2015-2023-sansibar.png
Glen Moray 2008/2021 - 12 Years old - Rum Matured & Cognac Finish	Glen Moray	57.8	85				How good is it?	This whisky reveals a wonderful aroma from the very first sniff. The fruitiness immediately jumps into the glass: notes of Bircher muesli with grapes, apple and a hint of peach dominate, accompanied by vanilla and a sweet honey flavour that combines elegantly with walnut. The fragrance is malty and slightly floral, while a hint of pear rounds off the fine, balanced sweetness.	On the palate, the single malt unfolds with an intense, almost surprising creaminess. The pepper notes provide a spicy kick, which is accompanied by ginger and counteracts the sweetness with an exciting sharpness. Apricot and malt come more to the fore, giving the whisky a velvety depth, while the oak spice provides structure and character.	The finish is short to medium in length, but leaves a pleasant, warming trace on the palate. The colourful peppercorns once again set the tone, while nutty tones and honey-like sweetness gently fade away. A malty base note and a good portion of oak spice give the finish depth before the whisky leaves a light, wintry spice note with a hint of speculoos.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-moray-2008-2021-rum-and-cognac	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:40 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:40 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-moray-private-cask-2008-2021-rum-cask.png
Mortlach Midnight Dusk - Diageo Special Releases 2024	Mortlach	57.5	233				Honest review without embellishment - is the price justified?	Okay, hats off - Mortlach has played all the cards right here. A lot of spices hit you straight away, followed by a delicate hint of citrus and apricot, which really makes you want more. The density of flavours is impressive: toffee, milk chocolate and a hint of leather create complexity. Cappuccino joins in, and then - bang - black pepper, which smells suspiciously like Szechuan pepper. This is Speyside with eggs!	And then you take the first sip and think: 'Wait a minute, that's it?' The oily texture is still okay, nougat tries to save what can be saved and the black pepper fights on bravely. A slight acidity brings some life into play, and if you're really imaginative, you might find a hint of fig.	Pleasant oak - nothing more, nothing less. Still spicy, medium length, baking cocoa and baking powder. Sounds solid? It is solid. But 'solid' is not what you expect from a premium release.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/mortlach-midnight-dusk-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:33 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:33 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/mortlach-midnight-dusk-diageo-special-releases-2024.png
Talisker Port Ruighe	Talisker	45.8	44				How good is it?	Hello Talisker - the Singla Malt opens with the unmistakable fruity, spicy and maritime-smoky notes of a Talisker. We think of warm custard, dark fruits and plums by the campfire. A little more hearty, notes of smoked bacon and oak lie in the background. Simply a Talisker.	The taste is probably best described as red wine barrels on a pirate ship. Very spicy-sweet and full-bodied, we taste red fruits, sweet smoke, as well as caramel and a slightly peppery spiciness. Further back, we perceive strong woody aromas and some dry bread.	Baking cocoa, a voluminous smoke, woody flavours and the typical Talisker chilli kick form the long-lasting finish.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/talisker-port-ruighe-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:03 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:03 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/talisker-port-ruighe.png
Balmenach 2013/2022 8 Year Old Barrique Finish - Best Dram	Balmenach	54.2	78				How good is it?	The nose of the 8-year-old Balmenach single malt is intense and immediately present. A clear note of ripe cherry jam immediately hits the senses, accompanied by deep nuances of fermented plums. A touch of heavy red wine and a hint of cane sugar round off the bouquet, while deep red wine gums add a sweet and tantalising dimension.	The first sip reveals a powerfully sweet flavour characterised by ripe fruit and subtle vinous notes. Dark wine gums provide a complex sweetness, while a pleasant warmth envelops the palate. A surprising sulphur note, reminiscent of rotten egg, adds an unexpected nuance.	The finish is extremely spicy and long-lasting, with a lingering sweetness that gradually gives way to a drier character. Dark chocolate remains.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/balmenach-8-year-old-barrique-cask-191-best-dram	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:12 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:43:12 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/balmenach-8-barrique-cask-191-best-dram.png
Lagavulin 2024 12 Year Old Fireside Tales - Diageo Special Releases 2024	Lagavulin	57.4	151				A new Lagavulin special release? The whisky nerd grabs his nosing glass faster than an Islay fisherman grabs his mackintosh. The ‘Fireside Tales’ from the Diageo Special Releases 2024 promises a warm, smoky story by the fireside.	Nose in and... Boom! A cloud of oil with a vanilla explosion meets cold smoke. Not that aggressive, medicinal Ardbeg smoke, but rather the subtle campfire flavour with a warming undertone. There is also a mineral flavour - almost as if someone had walked through a pine forest with a tropical fruit salad. Pineapple? Check. Peach? Check. A hint of banana? That's right. And somewhere in the background, a sea breeze blows past, reminiscent of salty spray. Sounds exciting? Yes! Are expectations rising? Oh yes!	Then the first sip - and oops, the fairy tale takes a sudden turn. Instead of sweet fruit, there is a good dose of ginger and bitter spiciness. This is joined by white pepper and, of course, the typical Lagavulin smoke - but this time cooler than usual. Fruit? Hardly at all. Instead, a curious mix of grilled vegetables, especially peppers, with a pinch of seaweed.	This is where the whisky comes into its own. Suddenly the pineapple reappears, as if it had got lost for a moment. Fruity, long-lasting and warming. There is also a light tar note and a hint of black pepper. Voluminous, intense - exactly what you want from a good Islay whisky.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/lagavulin-2024-12-year-old-fireside-tales-diageo-special-releases-2024	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:14 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:37:14 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/lagavulin-2024-12-year-old-fireside-tales-diageo-special-releases-2024.png
Royal Lochnagar 12 Year Old	Royal Lochnagar	40	38				How good is it?	We perceive sweet brown sugar, wood chips and citrus fruits. Light smoke lies unobtrusively, but nevertheless well recognisable in the background. A very exciting note of liquorice resonates.	The Scotch opens sweet, then dry and with minimal smoke. Licorice notes can also be perceived here. All in all, the composition reminds us of suede care products. The flavours are very defined, slightly oily and wonderfully rounded.	The finish flatters the palate, but is still strong and brings along minimal bitterness.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/royal-lochnagar-12-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:09 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/royal-lochnagar-12.png
Glen Moray 2007/2021 14 Year Old - Malts of Scotland	Glen Moray	56.3	79				There are whiskies that invite reflection, others that astonish. And then there are those that smile at you sweetly – only to throw a ginger bomb onto your palate a second later. The Glen Moray 2007/2021, bottled by Malts of Scotland, belongs to this third category – a surprising and exciting release from the Glen Moray distillery, located in the Speyside region near the Highlands. Aged for 14 years in a bourbon cask, bottled at a bold 56.3% ABV, non-chill filtered, natural colour – just the way we purists like it.	Once poured, the aromatic performance begins. The first impressions? Peach and apricot – nonstop. Ripe, almost tropically lush fruits, wrapped in a sweetness reminiscent of gummy bears – think Haribo Tropifrutti. Below that lies crumbly iced tea, somewhere between peach and black tea, with a touch of honey, very clear and floral. Then comes a wave of vanilla pudding topped with whipped cream. This is a bourbon cask bouquet overload that’s not simply typical – it’s compelling and multilayered. Even those who think they’ve tasted enough bourbon-matured whiskies might find themselves surprised.	The initial mouthfeel is slightly effervescent, perhaps due to the high ABV, yet never harsh – more like a ginger shot served with a wink. Then, a creamy texture unfolds, echoing that earlier vanilla pudding. Layers of lemon zest, lychee, and dragon fruit add freshness and finesse. The contrast is what makes this dram exciting: it begins like a comforting dessert, only to suddenly deliver a spicy punch with ginger and citrus. It’s different. And that’s what makes it memorable.	The finish is not overly long, but it’s pleasant and leaves a clear impression. Honeyed sweetness remains on the tongue, with ginger making one final statement. What’s particularly striking: there’s surprisingly little oak. For a 14-year-old matured in a bourbon barrel, that’s rare – and a testament to the elegant cask management. No wood overload, no bitterness – just a clean and graceful finale.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/glen-moray-2007-2021-14-year-old-malts-of-scotland	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:22 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:22 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/glen-moray-2007-2021-14-year-old-malts-of-scotland.png
Oban 14 Year Old	Oban	43	57				How good is it?	The Scotch opens with fruity notes of mango and peach. This is followed by a little spicy notes of tropical wood. A salty aroma and a hint of smoke resonate. Unexpectedly interesting.	The first sip of this whisky from the western Highlands reminds us of apricot, fruit preserves, rapeseed honey and white chocolate. Really sweet, you could say. The sweetness is then displaced by a salty-mineral and at the same time citrusy-sour blast of flavours. We think of apple cider with lemon curd.	Dry and salty with light oak notes, the single malt lingers for some time before disappearing without a trace.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/oban-14-year-old	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:06 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:44:06 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/oban-14.png
Macallan 2004/2024 20 Year Old Speymalt - Gordon & MacPhail	Macallan	59.4	325				Independent bottlers like Gordon & MacPhail provide a glimpse into the past, especially when it comes to iconic distilleries like Macallan. With the Speymalt 2004/2024, G&M presents a 20-year-old malt distilled at the Macallan distillery and matured in a sherry cask (No. 22606605). These casks are renowned for their complexity, and this whisky exemplifies the mastery of two decades of aging.	The first nosing reveals a fascinating medley of red fruits – sour cherries, dates, and figs lead the way. This is complemented by an elegant woody note reminiscent of driftwood, coupled with a slightly burnt character leaning towards cigar tobacco. This balance of sweet and earthy tones makes the bouquet remarkably layered.	The first sip is an experience: full-bodied and powerful, a pleasant sweetness greets the palate. The creamy, soft texture reveals notes of leather, cocoa powder, and dried plums. Subtle nutty tones play in the background, while oak takes on a leading role without dominating the profile. Each drop tells the story of a sherry cask transformed by time and care.	The finish is long and multi-layered: a sweet-spicy warmth spreads, accompanied by dry oak and nutty flavors, particularly walnuts. What remains is a harmonious, balanced finish that leaves the impression of a perfectly matured malt.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/macallan-2004-2024-20-year-old-speymalt-gordon-macphail-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:42:16 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/macallan-2004-2024-20-year-old-speymalt-gordon-macphail.png
Tomatin Legacy	Tomatin	43	24				Is the Tomatin Legacy the perfect entry-level whisky?	This is all about lightness and elegance. The fragrance is pleasantly sweet with a fine blend of vanilla biscuits, honey and a slightly malty note. This is joined by a fresh, fruity component - citrus fruits such as lime and orange are clearly perceptible, while a subtle tropical pineapple resonates in the background.	The Legacy is just as mild and friendly on the tongue as it is on the nose. Icing sugar and honey lend it a pleasant sweetness, while pear and a light grassy freshness provide variety. The texture is creamy, which makes the whisky pleasantly round. A gentle oak note creeps in in the background - not too dominant, but with a slightly soapy touch.	The finish is rather short and ends on a fresh, tangy note.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/tomatin-legacy-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:30 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:30 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/tomatin-legacy.png
Highland Park 2024 13 Year Old The Tasteful 8 - Brühler Whiskyhaus	Highland Park	57.7	129				When an independent bottler grabs a Highland Park, it can either be grandiose or risky. But The Tasteful 8 from Brühler Whiskyhaus shows that they know exactly what they are doing.	Fresh notes of menthol and eucalyptus meet a fine vanilla sweetness and a clear lemon zest. The whole is accompanied by a beautifully integrated cool smoke - more phenolic than powerful, like a cold campfire in the morning. Inviting and exciting at the same time.	The whisky immediately shows its strengths on the tongue: Warming, voluminous, fruity and sweet. The vanilla from the nose is back, but now with a pleasant depth. There is also a spicy, slightly salty note reminiscent of BBQ - as if grilled fruit and smoky meat had been combined. Powerful, but balanced.	The finish is quite lengthy and remains multi-layered. The notes of grilled vegetables and a fine herbal flavour are interesting here. Finally, a fine white sugar sweetness flashes up, which rounds off the whole thing nicely.	https://thewhiskyedition.com/highland-park-2024-13-year-old-the-tasteful-8-bruehler-whiskyhaus-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:47 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:47 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/highland-park-2024-13-year-old-the-tasteful-8-bruehler-whiskyhaus.png
Royal Brackla 2009/2021 11 Year Old - van Wees	Royal Brackla	46	49				After 11 years of maturation in Scottish warehouses, this Royal Brackla is presented at 46% ABV – a strength that promises to unfold its royal flavours while remaining drinkable for us mere mortals.	Vanilla quark floats elegantly from the glass, accompanied by malty base notes that immediately spread cosiness. It's like walking through the kitchen of a castle where fresh white bread is being baked – slightly yeasty, warm and inviting. But Royal Brackla wouldn't be royal if it didn't have something special: floral notes dance through the air like petals in the castle grounds, while grainy components provide a solid base. Apricot aromas sneak in discreetly – sweet, juicy and tempting. The highlight? Sandalwood notes that lend the whole an almost exotic elegance, followed by creamy marshmallows that awaken every childhood dream. This olfactory spectacle is rounded off by subtle nutty tones – sophisticated, but never intrusive.	The first sip starts like a fairy tale: sweet and creamy, the Royal Brackla caresses the tongue as if the royal chef himself were serving you the finest dessert. You think to yourself, 'Ah, this is going to be a relaxing evening!' But then – twist! Suddenly, a bitter wood note makes itself heard, as if the court jester had entered the hall unannounced. This bitterness is not necessarily unpleasant, but it is definitely surprising. It's as if the king suddenly shows his serious side. Slightly soapy notes join in (presumably the result of very clean distillation), while oatmeal textures provide a full-bodied feel. A subtle hint of liquorice hovers in the background – not dominant, but present enough to complete the flavour profile.	The finale is a mixture of nostalgia and reality. Vanilla returns like an old friend, accompanied by notes of yeast dough reminiscent of Sunday mornings at the bakery. Surprisingly, gummy bear flavours join in – who would have thought that Her Majesty had a sweet tooth?	https://thewhiskyedition.com/royal-brackla-2009-2021-11-year-old-van-wees-en	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:15 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)	Fri Oct 10 2025 09:36:15 GMT-0600 (Mountain Daylight Time)		https://static-content-provider.com/whisky/images/royal-brackla-2009-2021-11-year-old-van-wees.png
